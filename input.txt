Youth is a lie. It is nothing but evil.
Those of you, who rejoice in youth, are perpetually deceiving yourselves and
those around you. You perceive everything about the reality surrounding you in a
positive light. Even if you make a life-threatening mistake, it would still be seen as
proof of your youth- etched into a single page of your recollections.
IÅfll give you an example. If such people are to dabble in criminal acts such as
shoplifting or mass rioting, it would be called Åeyouthful indiscretionÅf. If they fail an
exam, they would claim that school is not only a place for studying. So long as
they are in the face of ÅeyouthÅf, theyÅfll be showcasing a distortion of any commonly
held beliefs or social norms.
Under their discretion, lies, secrets, crimes and even failure are nothing but the
spice of oneÅfs youth. And in their corrupt ways, they discover something peculiar
about failure. They conclude that while their own failures are generally a part of
relishing in youth, othersÅf failures should be shot down as just failures and
nothing more.
If failure could be seen as proof of one's youth, wouldnÅft it be strange not to
consider those who fail to make friends as experiencing the height of their
youth? Of course, they wouldnÅft acknowledge it.
It amounts to nothing. The whole thing is nothing but a result of their
opportunism. Therefore, it is a sham. Full of lies, deception, secrets and fraud that
ought to be condemned.
They are evil.
That is to say, ironic as it is, those who do not glorify their youth are the truly
righteous ones.
In conclusion, Riajuu1, go blow yourselves up.
Chapter 1: In any case, Hikigaya Hachiman is corrupt
My Japanese teacher, Shizuka Hiratsuka, popped a vein as she read my essay
aloud. As I listened, I realized that my writing skills were far from proficient. I
thought I might seem smart if I strung some fancy words together, but it just
came off like a cheap tactic some struggling writer would think of.
That said- is my amateurish essay the reason she called me? That couldn't be it. I
knew that already. After Hiratsuka sensei had finished reading, she put a hand on
her forehead and sighed deeply.
"Say, Hikigaya, what was the assignment that I handed out during class?"
"ÅcÅcwell, it was an essay with the topic ÅeLooking Back on High School LifeÅf."
"Exactly. So then why did you write a threat letter1? Are you a terrorist? Or
perhaps, an idiot?"
She let out another sigh and pulled a hand through her hair, vexed2.
"Pay attention!"
"Yes."
"Your eyes, theyÅfre like the eyes of a rotting fish."
"Do they really seem that rich in omega-3? Makes me sound smart."
The corners of her mouth twitched upwards.
"Hikigaya. What is with this tasteless essay? I'd at least like to hear some sort of
reason." Her eyes flashed, shooting daggers at me, with a scowl deadly enough to
make a sound. Only a woman cursed by beauty was capable of an expression so
alarmingly powerful that it would unwillingly draw you in and completely
overwhelm you. That is to say, it was seriously scary.
"Uh-Well-I...did reflect on high school life, didn't I? Nowadays this is exceedingly
what high school life is like, you know! My essay is pretty close to it!"
I kept fumbling my words. I get nervous just by talking to people, but talking to an
older woman made me all the more nervous.
"Usually, such a question would require you to reflect on your own experiences,
don't you think?"
"Then please preface the question by saying so. If you'd done that, I would have
written the essay accordingly. Isn't it your fault for writing a misleading question,
sensei?"
"Oh stop being so pedantic, kid."
"KidÅcÅc? Well certainly from the perspective of someone your age, I am a kid, I
guess."
There was a gush of wind. It was a fist. A fist that was unleashed without any
indication of movement. And if that weren't enough, it was an impressive fist that
just grazed the side of my cheek.
"The next one won't miss." Her eyes were serious.
"I'm very sorry. I'll write it over." To show some semblance of remorse and regret,
I'll have to choose my words wisely. But right now, of all things Hiratsuka sensei
was, satisfied was not one of them. It seemed there was no other way but to
kneel down and bow at her feet.
I attempted to brush the creases out of my pants, and as I neatened them, my
right leg bent down and became affixed to the floor. A flawless and swift
movement.
"You know, I'm not angry with you."
ÅcÅcOh, so it's come to that. That annoying thing they always do. The 'I'm not
angry, so please tell me' thing. I've never seen someone who says that not get
angry. Surprisingly, though, she really wasn't angry. Well, excluding the moment I
mentioned her age.
I furtively observed her reaction as I lifted my right knee off the floor.
From a breast pocket that was on the verge of bursting, Hiratsuka sensei pulled
out a Seven Stars4 and tapped its filter hard against her desk. Just like how some
old guy would do. After packing the tobacco, she clicked a 100-yen lighter and lit
her cigarette. She took a drag and considered me with a serious look on her face.
"You're not in any clubs, right?"
"Right."
"ÅcÅcDo you have any friends?"
She asked me like she had already assumed I didn't have any.
"Well, I- I'll have you know that I live by the virtue of impartiality, and as such, am
unable to have particularly intimate relationships with people!"
"In other words, you donÅft have any, right?"
"W-well, basicallyÅc"
As though she knew how I would reply, Hiratsuka sensei's face brimmed with
excitement.
"So that's how it is! You really don't have any friends! Exactly as I had diagnosed.
Just one look at those lifeless eyes and I knew straight away!"
So you figured it out just by looking at my eyes? Then, don't bother asking me.
She nodded her head knowingly with a 'mhmm...yes' and considered me with a
reserved expression.
"ÅcÅcÅcÅcWhat about a girlfriend or something?"
What's with the 'something'? What would you do if I said I had a boyfriend?
"Well I don't have one right now..."
Considering any hopes for the future, I emphasised ÅenowÅf, just in case.
"I see......"
This time she gazed at me intensely, with misty eyes. I really hoped it was because
of the cigarette smoke irritating her eyes.
Hey, stop that. Don't pity me with that soft gaze.
In any case, where are all these questions going? Is Hiratsuka sensei one of those
enthusiastic teachers?
Is she going to be talking about how I'm that one rotten apple that spoils the
barrel, soon?
Perhaps she was once a delinquent high school drop out, who's now going to go
back to her old high school to be a teacher?5......Seriously, canÅft she just go back
there?
After some consideration, Hiratsuka sensei sighed as she exhaled a puff of smoke.
"All right, let's do it this way. Rewrite your report."
"Yes."
And I definitely will.
All right, this time I'll write a highly appropriate, inoffensive composition. Much
like the blogs of gravure idols and voice actresses.
Something like: Today's dinner was likeÅcÅc, curry!
What's with using 'like'? There's nothing about that word that adds to the surprise
of eating curry.
Up until this point everything had gone as I expected. But what followed this was
more than I had imagined.
"However, the fact remains that your heartless words and behavior have hurt my
feelings. Were you never taught not to talk to a woman about her age? As a
result, you are required to join the service club. After all, wrongdoings must be
punished."
She didn't seem very hurt, so much so that she sounded commanding. Rather, she
was more perky than usual, speaking in a cheerful manner.
In saying that, the word perky6 inadvertently reminds me of something elseÅcÅcmy
eyes averted from reality and ended up settling on sensei's breasts pushing up
from underneath her blouse.
DespicableÅcÅcBut then, what kind of person delights in handing out punishments?
"The service clubÅcÅcWhat do you suppose I do there?" I timidly inquired. I get the
feeling they could quite possibly ask me to clean out the gutter or even worse,
kidnap people.
"Just follow me."
Hiratsuka sensei pressed the end of her cigarette onto a densely filled ashtray and
stood up. While I stayed rooted to the spot having had no explanation or
introduction to what she was proposing, sensei was already at the door, looking
back at me.
"Oi, hurry up."
With my brows knitted and a scowl on my face, I followed her.
The school building at Chiba Municipal Soubu High School has a slightly irregular
shape. If you look down at it from above, it looks just like the kanji for mouth (å˚)
and a lot like the katakana for (Éç ). Add the little audio-visual building at the
bottom, and it would complete the birdÅf s eye view of our school. The building
that contains the classrooms is on the side of the road and lies opposite to the
special building. A passageway on the second floor links the two buildings,
forming the square shape.
The space enclosed by the school building in all four directions is the holy
courtyard for the riajuu1. During lunchtime, both boys and girls eat lunch there
together. Then, they play badminton to help digest. After school, with the last
light of the sunset on the school building as a backdrop, they talk about love and
watch the stars as a salty sea breeze blows over them.
Are you kidding me?
From an outsiderÅfs perspective, it looks like theyÅfre actors in a youth drama trying
their best to play their respective roles. The thought can only make me
shudder. In such a drama, IÅfd probably play the ÅetreeÅf or something.
As Hiratsuka sensei click-clacked on the linoleum floor, it seemed as though she
was headed toward the special building.
I have a bad feeling about this.
For starters, something called the 'service club' can't be any good. The word
'service' here wouldn't be used in an everyday situation; rather the use of this
term would only be permitted in a restrictive sense. Like, for example, when
referring to the kind of service a maid provides for her master2. If it was this kind
of 'service', itÅfd be a real turn on and youÅfd really want to go 'Letsu Party!'3.
But in reality, such a thing wouldn't happen. No, actually, if you pay a set price it
would be possible. And if money can buy anything you want, even this kind of
thing, then I don't have any dreams or aspirations in such a rotten world. In any
case, 'service' isnÅft something good.
What's more, we had already reached the special building. I'll definitely have to
do stuff like move the piano from the music room, clean out the raw scraps from
the biology lab or sort out the books in the library or something along those lines.
In that case, I'll have to take precautions in advance.
ÅgI have this chronic disease in my lower backÅcÅcwhich is, herÅcherÅcherpes? Yeah,
that's itÅcÅcÅh
ÅgI think you're referring to hernia. However, there's no need for your worry. What
I'm asking you to do is not manual labor.Åh Hiratsuka sensei regarded me with an
exceedingly contemptuous expression.
Well then. Is it research, or some other kind of deskwork? That kind of work
means a mindless job that's more intense than manual labor. It's similar to the
torture of filling a hole in the ground, only to dig it out again.
ÅgI have this illness where I die upon entering a classroom.Åh
ÅgWhat long-nosed sniper does that remind me of? The one from the Straw Hat
Pirates?4Åh
So you read shounen manga?
Well, I don't mind laboriously doing work by myself. If I flip a switch in my mind,
making it clear that I am a machine, there would be no problem. And in the end, I
would pursue a mechanical body only to become a bolt.5
ÅgWe're here.Åh
The classroom sensei had stopped in front of was not unusual. There was nothing
written on the doorplate. As I was staring at it in wonder, sensei opened the
sliding door with a clatter. There were chairs and tables piled up in cluttered
stacks along the edge.
Perhaps it was being used as a storage room. In comparison to other classrooms,
there was nothing else special about its contents apart from that. It was an
exceedingly normal classroom. However, what was most obviously distinct from
everything else in the room, was a single girl.
By the light of the sunset, she was reading a book. Even if the world had ended,
she would still most certainly be sitting there, reading. That was the illusion she
gave, so much so, that it was like a scene from a painting.
The moment I saw it, both my mind and my body froze.
I was inadvertently fascinated by it.
Realizing there were visitors, she placed a bookmark in her paperback book and
looked up.
ÅgHiratsuka sensei. I thought I told you to knock before you enterÅcÅh
Elegant features. Long, flowing ebony hair. Wearing a uniform that should be the
same as the group of girls from my class, but still looks entirely different.
ÅgEven if I do knock, you never respond.Åh
ÅgThat's because you enter before I have time to respond.Åh She gave a
disapproving look in response to Hiratsuka sensei's words. ÅgAnd who is that
airhead with you?Åh She gave me a quick once-over with a cold look in her eyes.
I know this girl. It's Yukinoshita Yukino - Grade 11, Class J.
Obviously, I only know her by name and by face - I've never talked to her before.
There's no way I would have, because I seldom ever have conversations with
people at school.
At Soubu High School, apart from the nine standard classes, there is one class
aimed at nurturing talented students capable of fulfilling an active role in the
international arena. This class has an academic standard that is two to three times
better than the other classes. It mostly consists of students returning to Japan
from overseas or students who have aspirations to study abroad.
Among such a class, the one student that is prominent, or rather, naturally draws
people's attention and stands out brilliantly, is Yukinoshita Yukino. Whether it's a
regular exam or a placement exam, she is a high achiever who consistently sits at
the top of our grade. Simply put, she is virtually the most perfect and beautiful girl
in school and everyone knows who she is.
On the other hand, I am just your average, completely mediocre student. That's
why, even if she doesn't know me, I'm not offended in any way. Although, I was a
little bit hurt that she used the word 'airhead'. Hurt enough to distract myself
with the thought that there used to be a candy by that name and that I haven't
seen it around lately.
ÅgThis is Hikigaya. He's looking to join the club.
Prompted by Hiratsuka sensei, I nodded in acknowledgement. At this point it's
probably time to segue into a self-introduction.
ÅgI'm Hikigaya Hachiman - Grade 11, Class F. UmÅcHeyÅcWhat do you mean by
join?Åh Looking to join what? Join this club?
Sensei began to talk. Had she already guessed what I was going to say?
ÅgYou must engage in this club's activities as a penalty. I won't allow any
disagreement, objection, protest, questions or retorts. Cool down for a bit. Reflect
on your actions!Åh Without allowing me any room to protest, she declared her
verdict with great resolution. ÅgWith that being said, you can probably tell by
looking, but his heart is considerably corrupt. As a result, he's a pitiable, lonely
person.Åh
So you really can tell by just looking?
Sensei turned to face Yukinoshita and said, ÅgIf he could learn how to be sociable
he might just clean up his act a little. Can I leave him to you? I'm requesting that
you straighten out his corrupt, reclusive disposition.Åh
ÅgIf that's how it is, I think it would be a good idea if you beat and kick discipline
into him,Åh Yukinoshita replied grudgingly.
ÅcÅcWhat a scary woman.
ÅgI would if it was something I could do, but lately IÅfve been having some problems
myself. Also, physical violence isn't permitted.Åh
ÅcIt's like she's saying psychological violence is completely okay.
ÅgI respectfully decline. That boy's lecherous eyes are filled with hidden intent that
makes me feel that my life is in danger.Åh Yukinoshita set about readjusting her
collar, which was not particularly out of place to begin with, and glared at me.
I'm not looking at that extremely modest chest of yoursÅcÅcWait, am I? No, no I'm
not, I'm really not looking. It just entered my line of sight for a bit and I was
momentarily distracted.
ÅgDon't worry, Yukinoshita. Since his eyes and heart are both corrupt, he is quite
adept at self-preservation and calculating the trade-off between the benefits and
risks of doing something. He would never do something that would result in a
criminal charge. You can trust his petty thug nature.Åh
ÅgThat's not a compliment at allÅcAren't you mistaken? It's not about selfpreservation and analyzing risk-benefits, I'd rather you just say that I'm capable of
making sensible judgements.Åh
ÅgA petty thugÅc..I seeÅcÅc,Åh Yukinoshita said.
ÅgYou're not even listening to me and you ended up agreeing with herÅcÅh
Was Hiratsuka sensei successful in persuading her or did my petty thug nature
win her trust? No matter which way it was, Yukinoshita had come to see me as
everything I didn't want to be seen as.
ÅgWell, if it's a request from sensei, I can't very well refuseÅcÅcI accept.Åh
Yukinoshita said with incredible distaste.
Sensei smiled with satisfaction. ÅgOkay. Then, I'll leave the rest to you.Åh And with
that, she left the room with haste.
I was left standing there alone.
Honestly, I would be feeling a whole lot less stressed if they had just let left me by
myself. Being in an isolated environment, as I usually am, would make me feel
more at ease. The sound of the clock's second hand was so dreadfully slow that I
could hear it tick loudly.
Hey, wait, is this for real? A sudden romantic comedy development? An incredible
blanket of tension just came over the room. I had no complaints about the
situation.
Suddenly, I recalled a bittersweet memory from junior high school.
It's after school. There are two students alone in a classroom. The curtains sway
with the light breeze, and as the rays of the setting sun stream through, a young
boy gathers his courage and confesses.
I can still clearly remember that girl's voice. 'Can't we just be friends?'
Ah no, this is a bad memory. We never even spoke again after that let alone
stayed friends. Thanks to that, I ended up wondering if friendship was a
relationship in which people didnÅft have even have conversations with each
other.
Well, the point is, being alone together with a beautiful girl in a locked room like
some kind of romantic comedy would never happen to me in real life. Now that
IÅfm highly trained, there's no way I would fall into such a trap.
Girls are shown to be interested in hotties and popular people. They also engage
in impure relationships with them. The thought of it made me snigger.
In other words, they are my enemies.
Up until now, I've endeavored to make sure that I would never experience that
again. The quickest way to avoid getting caught up in a romantic comedy
development is by being hated. Lose the battle to win the war. I'll do anything to
protect my pride so I don't need things like popularity!
That said, in lieu of a greeting, I decided to intimidate Yukinoshita by scowling at
her. Wild beasts kill with their eyes!
Grrrrr Ñü!
In response, Yukinoshita glanced at me like I was a piece of trash. She narrowed
her large eyes as if to half-close them and let out a cold sigh. Then, with a voice
like the murmuring of a clear stream, she spoke to me.
ÅgÅcÅcHow about you stop standing there, making those disgusting growling noises,
and just sit down?Åh
ÅgHuh? Oh, yeah. Sorry.Åh
ÅcÅcWoah, what was with those eyes just now? A wild beast?
They would have certainly killed five people. Just like how that singer,
Matsushima Tomoko, got caught in that leopard's mouth.1 Did I just end up
instinctively and unconsciously apologizing to her? Even without me intentionally
trying to intimidate her, Yukinoshita had regarded me with hostility. Deeply
unnerved, I pulled up an empty chair and sat down.
Afterwards, Yukinoshita didn't show me an ounce of concern. At some point in
time, the paperback book had been opened again. The sound of the pages flipping
ensued. I couldn't tell what she was reading by the cover, but I figured it must
have been some kind of literary work. Something like Salinger, Hemingway or
Tolstoy. That's the kind of impression she gave.
Yukinoshita is like some kind of noble much in the way that she is an honor
student and also because no matter what, she would always be a beautiful girl.
But as is normal for such elite people, Yukinoshita Yukino is cut off from any social
circles. Just like her name, yuki no shita no yuki (The snow beneath the snow),
however beautiful she is, she is untouchable and unobtainable. The only thing
one can do is ponder her beauty.
Honestly, I never thought that through this absurd turn of events, I could be
acquainted with her. I'm sure if I boasted about it to my friends, they'd be jealous.
Even though I don't have friends I could boast to.
And so, what should I do with Miss Beautiful, here?
ÅgIs something wrong?Åh
It was probably because I was staring at her for too long, but Yukinoshita
furrowed her brows in displeasure and stared right back at me.
ÅgAh, my bad. I was thinking about what I should do about all this.Åh
ÅgAbout what?Åh
ÅgWell I mean, it's just that I was brought here with nothing but a confusing
explanation.Åh
In place of a Åetsk-tskÅf, she expressed her annoyance by vehemently snapping her
book shut. Then after glaring at me with her eyes, as though I was a mere bug,
she breathed a sigh of resignation and uttered a few words.
ÅgÅcÅcI suppose you're right. Then let's play a game.Åh
ÅgA game?Åh
ÅgYes. A game which requires you to guess what kind of club this is. So then, what
kind of club is this?Åh
A game with a beautiful girl in a locked roomÅc..
I can only feel that there is some kind of erotic element to this, however the vibes
she was giving off weren't light-hearted, but rather like that of a sharpened knife.
So sharp that I wondered if my life would end if I lost. Where did that romantic
comedy atmosphere go? Isn't this more like Kaiji?2
Giving into the pressure, I began to run a cold sweat as I surveyed the inside of
the room, trying to find a clue.
ÅgAre there any other club members?Åh
ÅgNo, there aren't.Åh
Is this club even able to continue as a club? I highly doubt it. To put it plainly,
there are no hints.
No, wait. On the contrary, there has been nothing but hints. Not to boast but ever
since I was little I was extremely good at one-player games, having few friends.
I have quite a bit of confidence in gamebooks3 and riddles. I think I could even win
in one of those high school quiz shows. Well if it's a club that can't recruit other
members, then other members canÅft participate. There are a lot of things I can
gather from this. If I organize my thoughts from the beginning, the answer should
become obvious.
ÅgA literary club?Åh
ÅgReally...? Your reason being?Åh Yukinoshita questioned with great interest.
"The peculiar setting, the lack of any need for special equipment and that despite
the fact that there aren't enough members the club hasn't been abolished. In
other words, itÅfs a club that doesn't require any expenses. In addition, you were
reading a book. The answer was apparent from the start."
Flawless reasoning, if I do say so myself. Even without an elementary school kid
with glasses saying 'Wah...really?' and giving me hints, something like this was a
piece of cake.4
It would even make Miss Yukino show some admiration and say 'I see...' with a
small huff.
"Incorrect." Yukinoshita gave a short and scornful laugh.
Åc..Now, this is getting on my nerves. Who the hell said you were the
irreproachable, perfect superman? YouÅfre more like the demon superman.5
ÅgThen what kind of club is this?Åh Despite the irritation in my voice, Yukinoshita
made no motion that she was bothered by it. She made it clear that the game
would continue.
ÅgAll right, IÅfll give you the biggest hint. My being here, doing what I am, is the
clubÅfs activities.Åh
Finally she gives me a hint. But it isnÅft related to the answer at all. Eventually IÅfll
just end up arriving at the same conclusion as before ? a literary club.
No, wait. Just wait a minute and calm down. Cool it. Be cool, Hikigaya Hachiman.
She said Åethere arenÅft any other club members apart from me.Åf Yet the club is still
functioning.
In other words, does that mean there are phantom members? Then the twist in
the story would be that the phantom members really are phantoms. And in the
very end, my romantic comedy would be slated to develop between a beautiful
phantom girl and me.
ÅgAn occult research society!Åh
ÅgI told you it was a clubÅcÅh
ÅgO-occult research club!Åh
ÅgWrongÅcÅcThatÅfs ridiculous. Ghosts donÅft exist.Åh
Without displaying the least bit of cuteness by saying something like ÅeB-because
you know, they really donÅft exist! IÅfm not saying that because IÅfm scared or
something!Åf she used all her power to look at me with the most scornful eyes.
They were the kind of eyes that said ÅeIdiots should die.Åf
ÅgI give up. I don't have a clue.Åh
As if IÅfd figure it out with just that. You shouldÅfve made it simpler. Something like,
ÅeThere is a flood of tears above but a blazing house fire below, why?Åf1 Wouldn't
that be because your house is actually on fire? At any rate, this isnÅft a guessing
game but a riddle.
ÅgHikigaya-kun. How many years has it been since youÅfve talked to a girl?Åh
She went ahead and asked such a sudden and irrelevant question to shatter my
line of reasoning. Some nerve this girl has.
IÅfm pretty confident in my ability to retain information. I can remember the kind
of trivial conversations that most people would forget - to the point where the
girls in my class treated me like a stalker. According to my superior hippocampus,
the last time I talked to a girl was two years ago in June.
Girl: ÅeItÅfs pretty hot today huh?Åf
Me: ÅeMore like humid, donÅft you think?Åf
Girl: ÅeWhat?...ÅcOhÅcUmÅcyeah, I guessÅf
End.
It went something like that. Well except for the fact that she wasnÅft actually
talking to me but to the girl sitting diagonally behind me. Humans more often
remember unpleasant memories. Even now, every time I recall that incident in
the middle of the night, I get the urge to pull the covers over my head and
scream.
Just as I was reliving that horrendous incident, Yukinoshita made a loud
proclamation.
ÅgThose that possess much are motivated by charity to give to those who do not.
People call this volunteer work. Providing development assistance to developing
countries, organizing soup-runs for the homeless, allowing an unpopular boy the
opportunity to talk to a girl. Extending a helping hand to those in need. That is
what this club does.Åh
At some point, Yukinoshita had stood up. Naturally, she was looking down at me.
ÅgWelcome to the service club. I invite you.Åh
The fact that she didnÅft sound very welcoming was apparent by the way she said
it straight to my face. That made me a little teary-eyed. She just kept rubbing salt
onto my wounds, depressing me even further.
ÅgAccording to Hiratsuka sensei, it is the duty of those who are superior to save
those who lead a pitiable existence.
I will make sure that I accomplish what she requested of me and fulfill this
responsibility. I will rectify your problem. Show some gratitude.Åh
Perhaps what sheÅfs alluding to is Åenoblesse obligeÅf. A French phrase referring to
the moral obligation of the noble to display honorable and generous conduct.
Yukinoshita standing there with her arms folded certainly spelled nobility. In fact,
it wouldnÅft be an exaggeration to call her noble, considering her grades and her
outward appearance.
ÅgThis bitchÅcÅcÅh
But, I must say no more. I ought to wield all the words I have at my disposal to
explain that I am not one to be pitied.
ÅgÅc. You know, even though itÅfs me saying it, IÅfm actually fairly superior myself. I
ranked third in the Japanese Proficiency exam! IÅfm pretty good-looking! If you
disregard the fact that I donÅft have a girlfriend or any friends, IÅfm basically top of
the line.Åh
ÅgThough IÅfm sure I heard you mention a fatal flaw towards the endÅcIn a way, itÅfs
amazing you can say all that so confidently. YouÅfre a weirdo. IÅfm already creeped
out.Åh
ÅgShut up. I donÅft want to hear that from a weird girl like you.Åh
She really is weird. At least that is what the rumors say. Rumors that I just
happened to hear since I donÅft recall ever talking to someone. They say that
Yukinoshita is very different from the girl she appears to be.
That probably means sheÅfs a so-called cool beauty. And right now she wore a cold
smile. To use a better descriptive word, a sadistic smile.
ÅgHmÅcBased on my observations, it seems that your loneliness is a result of your
corrupt mind and cynical temperament.Åh Yukinoshita concluded, eagerly. ÅgFirstly,
I will find a place for you in society. Given that youÅfre so pitiable, I just canÅft leave
you alone. Did you know? Just by finding a place to belong in, one can escape the
tragic fate of burning up to produce a star.Åh
Åg ÅeThe NighthawkÅfs StarÅf2, right? ThatÅfs pretty nerdy.Åh If I wasnÅft the culturally
aware prodigy who placed third in the Japanese Proficiency exam, I wouldnÅft have
gotten that reference. Also, since itÅfs a story I like, I remember it well. It was so
tragic that I actually cried. ItÅfs the kind of story that is well liked by everyone.
In response to my retort, YukinoshitaÅfs eyes widened in surprise. ÅgÅc..IÅfm
astonished. I never imagined that a below average high school boy would read
the works of Miyazawa Kenji.Åh
ÅgDid you just belittle me?Åh
ÅgIÅfm sorry. That may have been a bit of an exaggeration. Just short of average is
probably the correct thing to say.Åh
ÅgDonÅft you mean a bit too much of an exaggeration?! DidnÅft you hear me say I
ranked third in the grade?!Åh
ÅgTo be full of yourself just because you ranked third once is pathetic. Considering
the results of an examination in one subject as indicative of oneÅfs sharp intellect is
also pathetic.Åh
Åc.This girl. There is a limit to how rude one can be. For her to be treating a guy
she just met as belonging to an inferior race, I must only have as much knowledge
as the Prince of all Saiyans.3
ÅgAlthough, ÅeThe NighthawkÅfs starÅf suits you perfectly. Take for example, the
NighthawkÅfs physical appearance.Åh
ÅgAre you saying that my face is disfigured?....Åh
ÅgThatÅfs not what IÅfm trying to say. IÅfm just saying that sometimes the truth
hurtsÅcÅh
ÅgAren't you practically saying the same thing?!Åh
At this point, Yukinoshita took on a serious expression as she rested her hand on
my shoulder. ÅgYou should not look away from the truth. Look into a mirror to see
reality.Åh
ÅgHey, just wait a minute. Though it might be me saying it, my features are quite
handsome. Enough to have my sister tell me, ÅeOnii-chan, if only you didnÅft talk at
allÅcÅf Which is virtually the same as saying, the only thing good about me is my
looks.Åh
As expected of my sister. She has a good eye. Which, on the contrary, is
something that the girls in this school lack!
Yukinoshita placed a hand on her temple as though she had a headache. ÅgAre you
an idiot? Beauty is not something that can be decided about oneself subjectively.
In other words, as we are the only two people in this room, my objective opinion
is the only correct opinion.Åh
ÅgD-despite being confusing, somehow your argument makes senseÅcÅh
ÅgTo start with, eyes such as yours which emulate those of a rotten fish, would
invariably leave a bad impression. IÅfm not criticizing your facial features but rather
your facial expression, which is unattractive. It is proof of your considerably
twisted nature.Åh
As she talked, YukinoshitaÅfs face was certainly cute, but on the inside, it was
different. The look in her eyes was comparable to that of a criminal. She and I
both lack any cutesy charm.
ÅcÅcBut despite that, do my eyes really look like those of a fish? If I was a girl I
could interpret it as a plus saying, ÅeWhat? Do I really look like the Little Mermaid?Åf
Just as I was busy distracting myself with my musings, Yukinoshita flipped her hair
over her shoulder and said, as if in triumph, ÅgThe point is, being self-confident in
superficial aspects such as grades or physical appearance is unappealing. Not to
mention those rotten eyes of yours.Åh
ÅgEnough with the eyes already!Åh
ÅgYes, I suppose even if I say any more than this, it wonÅft change anything.Åh
ÅgYou can start by apologizing to my parents.Åh
I could feel my face twitch in anticipation of her response. It soon appeared that
even YukinoshitaÅfs expression became despondent as she reflected on her words.
ÅgI certainly said some horrible things. It must be painful for your parents.Åh
ÅgPlease just stop, itÅfs my fault. No, itÅfs my faceÅfs fault.Åh I entreated, on the verge
of getting teary-eyed. Finally, Yukinoshita put an end to her steely words. I quickly
realized that it was useless saying anything. And as I became immersed in a vision
of myself sitting at the foot of BuddhaÅfs tree, meditating with the aim to attain
enlightenment, Yukinoshita continued conversation.
ÅgWell then, that completes this conversation simulation. If you can converse with
a girl like me, then you should be able to talk to just about anybody.Åh Smoothing
her hair with her right hand, Yukinoshita gave an expression that was brimming
with a sense of accomplishment. Then she smiled pleasantly. ÅgNow you have this
spectacular memory to hold in your heart that will keep you going even when
youÅfre alone.Åh
ÅgIsnÅft that solution just wishful thinking on your part?Åh
ÅgBut if thatÅfs so, then it wouldnÅft fulfill senseiÅfs request...I have approach it on an
elementary levelÅclike for example, having you stop school.Åh
ÅgThat isnÅft a solution. ThatÅfs just like covering up a stench.Åh4
ÅgAh, so you are aware of the fact that you're a nuisance?Åh
"Is that why I receive these foul glares and people avoid me?Åh I attempted to
respond with a play on words, but to no avail.
ÅgÅcSo annoying.Åh
After I laughed at my somewhat witty remark, Yukinoshita glared at me as if to
say ÅeWhy are you even alive?Åf Like I said, her eyes were scary.
Then a silence descended upon the room ? enough to make my ears hurt. Actually
it was probably also because I let Yukinoshita say whatever she wanted that my
ears hurt.
However, the silence was soon shattered, as the door was violently pulled open
with a resounding clatter.
ÅgYukinoshita. IÅfm coming in.Åh
ÅgI told you to knockÅcÅh Yukinoshita sighed.
ÅgSorry, sorry. Don't mind me and just continue as you were. I just thought IÅfd stop
by and see how youÅfre doing.Åh Hiratsuka sensei gave Yukinoshita a generous
smile, and leaned against the classroom wall. She then looked back and forth
between Yukinoshita and me.
ÅgItÅfs nice that you two are getting along with each other.Åh
What made you draw that conclusion?
ÅgHikigaya, keep up the good work and focus on straightening out that cynical
temperament and curing those rotten eyes of yours. IÅfll be heading back now. Just
make sure you head home before the end of the school day.Åh
ÅgP-please just wait a second!Åh I grabbed senseiÅfs hand in an attempt to stop her.
In that instant-
ÅgOw! Owwwww! I give up! I give up!Åh
She had me in an armlock. After I frantically tapped out and admitted defeat, she
finally let me go.
ÅgOh it was just you Hikigaya. DonÅft just carelessly stand behind me because IÅfll
instinctively unleash my powerful techniques on you.Åh
ÅgWhat are you, Golgo1? Besides, arenÅft you the careless one? DonÅft do that so
suddenly!Åh
ÅgArenÅft you demanding?...Anyway, whatÅfs the problem?Åh
ÅgThe problem is you....what do you mean by Åestraighten outÅf? DoesnÅft that make
me sound like a juvenile delinquent? Just what the hell is this all about?Åh
Hiratsuka sensei rubbed her chin thoughtfully for a moment.
ÅgDidnÅft Yukinoshita explain it to you? Basically, the main aim of this club is to help
people solve their problems by encouraging self-improvement. I guide students
who I believe require self-improvement to this club. You can think of it as the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber2. Or perhaps Revolutionary Girl Utena3, if that makes it
easier to understand.Åh
ÅgIt made it even more difficult to understand and just illustrates how old you are.Åh
ÅgWhat did you just say?Åh
ÅgÅc.Nothing at all.Åh I murmured retreating into myself after being shot by the
terribly frosty expression she gave me.
Hiratsuka sensei sighed as she observed me.
ÅgYukinoshita. It appears that youÅfre having a hard time straightening him out.Åh
ÅgThatÅfs because he himself isnÅft aware of the fact that he has a problem.Åh
Yukinoshita replied coldly in response to senseiÅfs troubled expression.
ÅcÅcThis feelingÅc.I just canÅft stand to be here another second. It feels similar to
the time when my parents found out about my porn stash in sixth grade and kept
lecturing me about it.
No, probably not that bad.
ÅgUmÅcyouÅfve been saying nonsensical stuff about straightening me out and
improvement and reformation and revolutionary girls and whatnot for a while
now, but I never really asked for any of itÅcÅh
Hiratsuka sensei cocked her head slightly in confusion. ÅgHm?Åh
ÅgÅcWhat are you saying? If you donÅft change, youÅfll be at a level thatÅfll make living
in society difficult.Åh Yukinoshita looked at me as if her argument was as justified
as saying ÅeWar is fruitless. Lay down your arms.Åf ÅgIt appears that your humanity is
severely inferior to that of others. DonÅft you want to change that part of
yourself?Åh
ÅgThatÅfs not itÅc.I donÅft want people who keep harping on about making me
change, telling me who I am. Generally, to change yourself at the word of another
would mean that you wouldnÅft be yourself anymore right? It is said that the self
isÅcÅh
ÅgThe self is such that it cannot be viewed by oneself objectively.Åh
My attempt at sounding impressive by ripping a saying off Descartes was
intercepted by Yukinoshita...Even though I was about to say something pretty
good.
ÅgYouÅfre just running away from the problem. If you donÅft change, you wonÅft move
forward.Åh Yukinoshita said, cutting me down with her harsh words. Why has she
been so hostile and snappy the whole time? Are her parents crabs or something?
ÅgWhatÅfs wrong with running away? DonÅft keep telling me to change like an idiot
who only knows one thing.
If youÅfre like that then do you do things like face the sun and say, ÅeThe westering
sun is too intense and everybodyÅfs bothered by it so please set in the east from
now on.Åh
ÅgThatÅfs fallacy. Please donÅft stray from the issue at hand. The sun does not move -
it is the Earth that moves. DonÅft you know the heliocentric theory?Åh
ÅgThat was just a figure of speech! If that was fallacy then what youÅfre saying is
also fallacy. By changing, in the end IÅfd be changing in order to run away from the
problem. So whoÅfs running away from the problem now? If I really wasnÅft running
away from the problem, I wouldnÅft change and just stay right where I am. Why
canÅft you just accept my past and the way am I now?Åh
ÅgÅc.If thatÅfs how it is, it wouldnÅft solve any problems or save anybody.Åh As
Yukinoshita spoke the word ÅesaveÅf, her expression was that of bloodcurdling
anger. I inadvertently flinched. I was on the verge of apologizing by blurting out a
ÅeS-s-s-s-sorry!Åf if needed be. Talking about salvation isnÅft usually something a
mere high school student would do. I just canÅft understand what it is that is
driving her this far.
ÅgBoth of you just calm down.Åh Hiratsuka senseiÅfs calm tone eased what was to
become, or rather, what had been an unpleasant atmosphere from the very start.
Just by looking at her grinning face, you could tell that she was full of anticipation
and delight. ÅgThings have become interesting. I love developments like these. ItÅfs
like JUMP4, which is nice donÅft you think?Åh
Somehow, sensei was the only one who was ecstatic. Even though she was
female, her eyes were like those of a young boy. ÅgSince before ancient times,
when two collide in the name of justice, it is customary in shounen manga to
battle it out in an all or nothing match.Åh
ÅgBut weÅfre not in a shounen mangaÅcÅh Nobody paid attention to me.
As sensei let out a resounding laugh, she turned to us and made a loud
announcement.
ÅgWell then letÅfs do it this way. From now on, I will guide troubled lambs to this
club where they will be under your supervision. The both of you will try and help
them as you see fit. And it would be good if you prove your moral righteousness
to each other to the best of your ability. Who can help these people?! Gundam
Fight. Ready, Go!!Åh5
ÅgI refuse.Åh Yukinoshita declared, bluntly rejecting her proposition. Her eyes
harbored the same coldness that had been directed at me only a little while ago.
Well, since I agreed with her, I nodded in assent. Not to mention that G Gundam
isnÅft from our generation.
After sensei had registered our unwillingness, she bit her nails in frustration.
ÅgTch, maybe a Robattle5 would have been easier to understandÅcÅh
ÅgThatÅfs not the problemÅcÅh
Games like ÅeMedabotsÅf are too geekyÅcÅc
ÅgSensei. Please stop acting childishly hyperactive. It is unbecoming of someone
your age and itÅfs awfully indecent.Åh Yukinoshita hurled ice-cold sharp words like
they were icicles. It wasnÅft clear if sensei had calmed down or not, but in an
instant senseiÅfs face was colored pink in embarrassment. She cleared her throat
so as to cover up her faux pas.
ÅgIn-in any case! The only thing that will prove oneÅfs rectitude is their actions! If I
said you must have a match, then you will have a match. Neither of you have the
right to say no.Åh
ÅgThatÅfs too tyrannicalÅc.Åh
SheÅfs exactly like a kid! The only part of her thatÅfs adult like is her chest. Well, in
something as stupid as a battle IÅfd lose for fun. Hah. But getting a star for my
efforts wouldnÅft be so bad. To say that thereÅfs meaning in participating in such a
thing is a convenient and overly extravagant thing to say.
Nonetheless, the overly detestable woman child6 with a mind full of shounen
manga was still spouting absurd remarks.
ÅgIn order for you to fight with your utmost desperate efforts, IÅfll provide a little
motivation. How about, the winner can command the loser to do anything they
wish?Åh
ÅgAbsolutely anything?!Åh
By anything, it must mean that right? It canÅft be anything but that
anythingÅc.gulp.
Suddenly, the sound of a chair being pulled back could be heard. Yukinoshita had
moved back two meters, embracing her body as she took a defensive position.
ÅgCompeting against this boy makes me feel that my chastity is in peril. I refuse.Åh
ÅgPrejudice! ItÅfs not as if all second year high school boys only think about obscene
stuff!Åh There are a lot of other things like, uhÅc.IÅfm thinking! Åc..world peace? Stuff
like that? Other than that, thereÅfs not much else I think about.
ÅgSo even Yukinoshita Yukino is fearful of somethingÅc.Are you that afraid youÅfll
lose?Åh Hiratsuka said with a malicious face. Yukinoshita appeared a little offended
at that.
ÅgÅc.Fine. Although, IÅfm a little annoyed that I must give in to such cheap
provocation. I accept. While weÅfre at it, IÅfll let you deal with that boy, also. Åh
Woah, YukinoshitaÅfs a sore loser. How is she the type that hates to lose, you ask?
The fact that she basically said ÅeI can see right through your intentionsÅf like
someone who hates to lose. I mean, what does she mean by Åedeal withÅf? YouÅfre
scary already so just stop it.
Hiratsuka sensei grinned broadly, ignoring YukinoshitaÅfs gaze.
ÅgThen itÅfs decided.Åh
ÅgHey, you havenÅft asked me if I acceptÅc.Åh
ÅgOne look at that grin on your face and I saw no point in asking you.Åh
I seeÅc.
ÅgI will decide the winner of this match. Of course, the decision will be influenced
by my opinion and bias. DonÅft think about it too much and just act accordinglyÅc.in
an appropriate and proper manner and do your best.Åh Having uttered these
words, Hiratsuka sensei left the room, leaving only a very cross Yukinoshita and I
behind.
Of course, thereÅfs nothing to talk about. While remaining motionless in that silent
room, a sound like that of a broken radio resounded. It was sign that a chime was
about to ring. Indeed, after a synthesized chime had sounded, Yukinoshita
suddenly closed her book. It seemed that the chime indicated the end of the
school day.
With that as a signal, Yukinoshita quickly set about getting her things together to
go home. After she had carefully put her book in her bag, she stood up. Then, she
gave me a fleeting glance. And with just that and not a word, she left. Without
even a Åesee you tomorrowÅf or a ÅegoodbyeÅf, she had briskly walked out. I didnÅft
even get the chance to call her out on her exceedingly cold reception.
And there I was all-alone, the only one left in that room. Was today an unlucky
day or something? I got called to the teacherÅfs lounge, was forced to join a
mysterious club and got verbally abused by a girl whose good looks are wasted on
the only cute part of her ? her face. IÅfve sustained some considerably extensive
damage.
IsnÅft talking to a girl supposed to make you more excited? My heart only sank in
despair.
If itÅfs going to be like this, then talking to stuffed animals everyday would be a lot
better. They donÅft talk back and they always smile brightly at you. Why wasnÅft I
born a hardcore masochist?
And on top of that, why am I forced to compete in such a pointless match? With
Yukinoshita as my opponent, I donÅft think I can win. I wonder if something like a
match would generally be considered part of club activities. When I think of club
activities, something like what those girl bands do on those DVDs would be just
right.
With things continuing as they are now, will we ever be able to get along? Not
likely.
SheÅfd probably command me in that unconcerned manner by saying something
like, ÅeYour breath smells, so could you stop breathing for at least three hours?Åf
As I expected, youth is full of nothing but lies.
After losing a baseball tournament during their third year, they shed tears to
make themselves seem beautiful. After failing their college entrance exam, they
insist that their failure is simply a life experience. After failing to confess to the
person they like, they withdraw. They deceive themselves by feigning ignorance,
saying that they were thinking about that personÅfs happiness.
And then thereÅfs that. Anticipating a romantic comedy with an unsociable,
irritating so-called tsundere7 girl that is never going to happen. My essay does not
require any amendments. As I expected; youth is a pretence, a deceptive word,
and fraudulent.
As I was exiting the classroom after homeroom had finished, I spotted Hiratsuka
sensei lying in wait for me. She was like a prison guard, standing completely
motionless with her arms folded. In fact, if she had come dressed in military
uniform and been given a whip, it would probably suit her a little too much. Well
since school is pretty much like a jail, that wouldnÅft be too much of a stretch of
the imagination. I mean you could compare it to Alcatraz or Cassandra1. It would
be nice if the Savior of the CenturyÅfs End would hurry up and arrive.2
ÅgHikigaya. ItÅfs time for club activities.Åh
As she soon as she said that, I could suddenly feel my blood run cold. Crap. IÅfm
going to be arrested. If I get escorted to the clubroom I seriously will lose all hope
in my school life.
Yukinoshita, a natural born stuck-up, speaks words that are sort of venomous.
TheyÅfre really just abusive and not cute at all. Would you call that being a
tsundere? Oh wait, that just describes a plain old bitch.
But despite that, Hiratsuka sensei didnÅft give me an ounce of consideration and
wore a smile of indifference.
ÅgLetÅfs go.Åh Hiratsuka sensei said and attempted to grab my arm. I evaded her.
Without hesitating, she reached out her hand again. I barely dodged her again.
ÅgUmm, you seeÅcI think that well, among other things, our education system is
supposed to encourage and respect studentsÅf independenceÅcso I would like to
object to the way I am being forced to do thisÅcÅh
ÅgUnfortunately, schools are institutions that are designed to train students to
become well-integrated citizens of society. Once you go out into society nobody is
going to care about your opinion. So youÅfd better start getting used to being
forced to do things.Åh As soon as sensei had said that, her fist came flying at me.
She didnÅft give me a regular punch but a full-blown body blow with her clenched
fist drilling into me like a screw. It was so powerful I couldnÅft breath. Then without
missing a second, she stopped trying to kill me and gripped my hand instead.
ÅgYou know whatÅfll happen if you try and bail again, right? DonÅft try and provoke
my fist.Åh
ÅgAre you really dead set on using your fistÅcÅh
ThereÅfs no way the pain could get any worse.
As we were walking, Hiratsuka sensei opened her mouth as though sheÅfd
remembered something.
ÅgOh thatÅfs right. If you try to escape again you will lose the match with
Yukinoshita by default. No buts allowed. In addition, you will be penalized. ItÅfd be
best not to expect that you will be able to graduate in your final year.Åh
There was definitely no way I was getting out of this anytime soon. Not mentally
either for that matter. As the sound of her heels click clacking on the floor
resounded, sensei walked beside me. To make things worse, she gripped my arm.
Any other circumstance and it would have looked like sensei was a bar hostess
cosplaying as a teacher who was escorting me to her cosplay cabaret.
But there were three things that were different. Firstly, I wasnÅft paying her any
money. Secondly, she wasnÅft actually gripping my arm but the end of my elbow.
Lastly, I wasnÅft happy or excited at all. Well except for the fact that the end of my
elbow was touching senseiÅfs breast.
The only place sheÅfs taking me right now is that clubroom.
ÅgUm, IÅfm not going to run away or anything so IÅfll be okay going by myself. I mean
you know IÅfm always alone. IÅfm totally fine by myself. Or rather, if IÅfm not by
myself I canÅft keep my composure.Åh
ÅgDonÅft say such sad things. I want us to go together.Åh Sensei gave a soft sigh and
smiled gently. It was totally different from the usual narrowed eyes she looks at
me with. The difference startled me.
ÅgLetting you escape would be enough to make me grind my teeth. So even if I
donÅft want to, IÅfll have to drag you there to ease my mental stress.Åh
ÅgThatÅfs the worst excuse ever!Åh
ÅgHow should I put it? Even though IÅfm absolutely fed up with all this, IÅfm still
accompanying you there for the sake of straightening you out. This is what you
would call a beautiful bond of love between a teacher and her student.Åh
ÅgThis is love? If this is love then I donÅft need it.Åh
ÅgWell that excuse just shows that you really are twisted, doesnÅft it?.....So twisted
that your pressure points are reversed? Are you going to be constructing the Holy
Cross Mausoleum or something?Åh3
You seriously love manga too muchÅc
ÅgIf you were a little more compliant youÅfd be cuter. It canÅft be much fun looking
at the world through that distorted view of yours.Åh
ÅgWell itÅfs not like the world is full of sunshine and daisies. If society was only
shaped by the view that one must be happy-go-lucky all the time, Hollywood
wouldnÅft make tear-jerking movies would they? One can find pleasure in
tragedies.Åh
ÅgMaking speeches like that must be pretty typical for you. Although itÅfs pretty
common for young people to be cynical, for you itÅfs already an illness. An illness
characteristic of eleventh graders. Yeah you really do have ÅekounibyouÅf.Åh4
Hiratsuka sensei wore a brilliant smile as she confirmed my ÅeillnessÅf.
ÅgHey, isnÅft that a little too harsh? Treating me like I have an illness. I mean what
the hell is ÅekounibyouÅf anyway?Åh
ÅgDo you like manga and anime?Åh Ignoring my request for an explanation, she
changed the subject.
ÅgWell, I donÅft dislike it or anything.Åh
ÅgSo why do you like it?Åh
ÅgWell thatÅfs becauseÅcÅc.ItÅfs representative of Japanese culture. ItÅfs also a part of
pop culture that is recognised as the pride of Japan. WouldnÅft it be strange if I
didnÅft acknowledge that fact? Since the domestic market is becoming larger, we
canÅft ignore it on an economic front either.Åh
ÅgI see. How about general literature, then? Higashino Keigo and Isaka Koutarou4
and the like?Åh5
ÅgWell I have read them but honestly, I like the books they wrote before they
became popular.Åh
ÅgWhat are you favorite light novel publishing labels?Åh
ÅgGagagaÅc.and Kodansha Box6. Well I donÅft know if you can consider what
Kodansha Box publishes as light novels though. Why are you asking me all this
stuff?Åh
ÅgWell. YouÅfve really met my expectations ? not in a good way. A perfect instance
of kounibyou.Åh
ÅgLike I said, what the hell is ÅekounibyouÅf?Åc.Åh
ÅgKounibyou is simply Kounibyou. A common state of mind experienced by high
school students. They think that being cynical is cool and always express views
that are popular on the internet such as ÅeWork and you lose to the systemÅf.7
When referring to popular novelists and manga writers, they say ÅeI like the books
they wrote before they became popularÅf. They mock things that everybody
worships and praise those that are obscure. And on top of that, they make fun of
otakus even though they are like them. While giving off an air like they
understand everything, they spout twisted logic. Basically, theyÅfre unlikable.Åh
ÅgUnlikableÅc. Crap! ThatÅfs pretty much spot on so I canÅft refute!Åh
ÅgNo, IÅfm kind of praising you. Students are actually quite clever these days and
come to terms with reality quite easily. As a teacher, itÅfs not as if I find it fun to
point out your faults. I mean considering the way that IÅfm talking to you like
youÅfre an adult it feels like weÅfre working right now.Åh
ÅgStudents these days, huh?Åh I couldnÅft help the wry smile that crept across my
face. What a clich? thing to say. Feeling kind of pissed off, I thought about
responding with a slight retort. However after noticing sensei staring hard into my
eyes, I just shrugged my shoulders.
ÅgIt looked like you were just about to say something but it was probably
something completely characteristic of someone with kounibyouÅh
ÅgÅc.Oh really.Åh
ÅgI donÅft want you to get the wrong idea but IÅfm seriously kind of praising you. I
like people who stick to their ideas. Even though they may be twisted.Åh
Having her say ÅelikeÅf so suddenly could only leave me stumped for words like an
idiot. I found myself worrying about trying to find a retort to counter words I
wasnÅft used to hearing.
ÅgBeing as twisted as you are, what do you think of Yukinoshita Yukino?Åh
ÅgSheÅfs a bitch.Åh I immediately replied. I hated her so much that it was as though
sensei had said ÅeI think you should give up on ÅgConcrete RoadÅh.Åf8
ÅgI see.Åh Hiratsuka sensei said with a bitter smile. ÅgAlthough, she really is an
extraordinarily excellent studentÅc.Well, those who ÅehaveÅf may indeed suffer just
by ÅehavingÅf. But still, she is a very sweet girl.Åh
In what way? I thought, shaking my head in my mind.
ÅgShe would certainly have some kind of ÅeillnessÅf too. SheÅfs kind and occasionally
right. But society is neither kind nor righteous. IÅfm sure itÅfs a hard way to live.Åh
ÅgPutting aside the fact that sheÅfs righteous and kind, IÅfm sure most of society
would agree with you.Åh As soon as I said that, sensei looked at me as if to say
ÅeThatÅfs what I was thinking.Åf
ÅgAs I expected you are ? the both of you are quite contrary. IÅfm worried about the
fact that neither of you seem like youÅfll be able to adapt to society well. ThatÅfs
why I want to bring you both to the same place.Åh
ÅgWould that be an isolation ward?.....Åh
ÅgYeah probably. I like watching students like you two, its fun. So maybe itÅfs just
that I want the both of you to be close by.Åh She laughed cheerfully.
Then, like always, she had trapped me in an armlock. Both her arms locked mine
around her torso so that they were held straight.9 This mixed martial arts type
move was probably influenced by manga. As my elbows made this unpleasant
creaking sound, they kept rubbing up against senseiÅfs huge bust.
Åc..Jeez. As per usual, IÅfm finding it difficult to escape after having her pull a
perfect move on me. ItÅfs vexing but it shouldn't be long before I have to just give
in to this feeling.
No actually IÅfm already done for.
At that point I thought, since there are two breasts, ÅebustÅf should be pluralized as
ÅebustsÅf.
Once we reached the special building, sensei finally released me. Maybe she had
finally stopped worrying about me running away. Nevertheless, she kept glancing
in my direction as she left me there. She didnÅft express any sentiment that was
remotely compassionate by saying something like ÅeIÅfm sorry to part with youÅf or ÅeI
hate to leave youÅcÅf. The only vibe she was giving off was an intense will to kill
that was saying ÅeYou understand what will happen if you run away right?...Åf
I smiled wryly at that as I walked down the hallway.
There was dead silence at one end of the special building and the air was chilly.
There should have been other clubs going on but I hadnÅft heard any noises that it
indicated it as such, yet. I didnÅft know if it was because this was the special
building or if it was because of her. A result of the strange aura Yukinoshita Yukino
was emitting.
I put my hand on the door to open it. Honestly, I was feeling depressed but on the
other hand the thought of running away irritated me too. The important thing is
not to let anything she says get to me. I shouldnÅft think about us being alone
together. I should just think of her being there and me being there separately.
If thereÅfs no relation between us, I wouldnÅft have to feel awkward and
uncomfortable.
