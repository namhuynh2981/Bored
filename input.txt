Those of you, who rejoice in youth, are perpetually deceiving yourselves and those around you. You perceive everything about the reality surrounding you in a positive light. Even if you make a life-threatening mistake, it would still be seen as proof of your youth- etched into a single page of your recollections. IÅfll give you an example. If such people are to dabble in criminal acts such as shoplifting or mass rioting, it would be called Åeyouthful indiscretionÅf. If they fail an exam, they would claim that school is not only a place for studying. So long as they are in the face of ÅeyouthÅf, theyÅfll be showcasing a distortion of any commonly held beliefs or social norms. Under their discretion, lies, secrets, crimes and even failure are nothing but the spice of oneÅfs youth. And in their corrupt ways, they discover something peculiar about failure. They conclude that while their own failures are generally a part of relishing in youth, othersÅf failures should be shot down as just failures and nothing more. If failure could be seen as proof of one's youth, wouldnÅft it be strange not to consider those who fail to make friends as experiencing the height of their youth? Of course, they wouldnÅft acknowledge it. It amounts to nothing. The whole thing is nothing but a result of their opportunism. Therefore, it is a sham. Full of lies, deception, secrets and fraud that ought to be condemned. They are evil. That is to say, ironic as it is, those who do not glorify their youth are the truly righteous ones. In conclusion, Riajuu1 , go blow yourselves up. 1 A reference to the Japanese Internet meme - Riajuu, bakuhatsu shirou! - based on a vocaloid song sung by Hatsune Miku. It is used to refer to someone who has a good life, a boyfriend or girlfriend and are popular with his or her peers. It is typically used by otaku. 1-1 Chapter 1: In any case, Hikigaya Hachiman is corrupt My Japanese teacher, Shizuka Hiratsuka, popped a vein as she read my essay aloud. As I listened, I realized that my writing skills were far from proficient. I thought I might seem smart if I strung some fancy words together, but it just came off like a cheap tactic some struggling writer would think of. That said- is my amateurish essay the reason she called me? That couldn't be it. I knew that already. After Hiratsuka sensei had finished reading, she put a hand on her forehead and sighed deeply. "Say, Hikigaya, what was the assignment that I handed out during class?" "ÅcÅcwell, it was an essay with the topic ÅeLooking Back on High School LifeÅf." "Exactly. So then why did you write a threat letter1 ? Are you a terrorist? Or perhaps, an idiot?" She let out another sigh and pulled a hand through her hair, vexed2 . 1 The original word used here is ÅehankouseimeiÅf, which is the same as a claim of responsibility (for a crime), but that sounded too hefty in English. 2 The Japanese word for ÅevexÅf (nayamashi) can also mean ÅeseductiveÅf, which leads him to his next thoughtÅc 1 1-1 Now that I think about it, using the word mistress instead of 'female teacher' makes it sound more erotic3 . Then, just as I was grinning to myself while thinking about those things, a bundle of paper struck my head. "Pay attention!" "Yes." "Your eyes, theyÅfre like the eyes of a rotting fish." "Do they really seem that rich in omega-3? Makes me sound smart." The corners of her mouth twitched upwards. "Hikigaya. What is with this tasteless essay? I'd at least like to hear some sort of reason." Her eyes flashed, shooting daggers at me, with a scowl deadly enough to make a sound. Only a woman cursed by beauty was capable of an expression so alarmingly powerful that it would unwillingly draw you in and completely overwhelm you. That is to say, it was seriously scary. "Uh-Well-I...did reflect on high school life, didn't I? Nowadays this is exceedingly what high school life is like, you know! My essay is pretty close to it!" 3 The original Japanese dictates that the kanji for female teacher (èóã≥ét) would be more erotic if it were read as ÅeonnakyoushiÅf (woman teacher) instead of ÅejokyoushiÅf (female teacher). 2 1-1 I kept fumbling my words. I get nervous just by talking to people, but talking to an older woman made me all the more nervous. "Usually, such a question would require you to reflect on your own experiences, don't you think?" "Then please preface the question by saying so. If you'd done that, I would have written the essay accordingly. Isn't it your fault for writing a misleading question, sensei?" "Oh stop being so pedantic, kid." "KidÅcÅc? Well certainly from the perspective of someone your age, I am a kid, I guess." There was a gush of wind. It was a fist. A fist that was unleashed without any indication of movement. And if that weren't enough, it was an impressive fist that just grazed the side of my cheek. "The next one won't miss." Her eyes were serious. "I'm very sorry. I'll write it over." To show some semblance of remorse and regret, I'll have to choose my words wisely. But right now, of all things Hiratsuka sensei was, satisfied was not one of them. It seemed there was no other way but to kneel down and bow at her feet. 3 1-1 I attempted to brush the creases out of my pants, and as I neatened them, my right leg bent down and became affixed to the floor. A flawless and swift movement. "You know, I'm not angry with you." ÅcÅcOh, so it's come to that. That annoying thing they always do. The 'I'm not angry, so please tell me' thing. I've never seen someone who says that not get angry. Surprisingly, though, she really wasn't angry. Well, excluding the moment I mentioned her age. I furtively observed her reaction as I lifted my right knee off the floor. From a breast pocket that was on the verge of bursting, Hiratsuka sensei pulled out a Seven Stars4 and tapped its filter hard against her desk. Just like how some old guy would do. After packing the tobacco, she clicked a 100-yen lighter and lit her cigarette. She took a drag and considered me with a serious look on her face. "You're not in any clubs, right?" "Right." "ÅcÅcDo you have any friends?" 4 A brand of cigarettes in Japan 4 1-1 5 1-1 She asked me like she had already assumed I didn't have any. "Well, I- I'll have you know that I live by the virtue of impartiality, and as such, am unable to have particularly intimate relationships with people!" "In other words, you donÅft have any, right?" "W-well, basicallyÅc" As though she knew how I would reply, Hiratsuka sensei's face brimmed with excitement. "So that's how it is! You really don't have any friends! Exactly as I had diagnosed. Just one look at those lifeless eyes and I knew straight away!" So you figured it out just by looking at my eyes? Then, don't bother asking me. She nodded her head knowingly with a 'mhmm...yes' and considered me with a reserved expression. "ÅcÅcÅcÅcWhat about a girlfriend or something?" What's with the 'something'? What would you do if I said I had a boyfriend? 6 1-1 "Well I don't have one right now..." Considering any hopes for the future, I emphasised ÅenowÅf, just in case. "I see......" This time she gazed at me intensely, with misty eyes. I really hoped it was because of the cigarette smoke irritating her eyes. Hey, stop that. Don't pity me with that soft gaze. In any case, where are all these questions going? Is Hiratsuka sensei one of those enthusiastic teachers? Is she going to be talking about how I'm that one rotten apple that spoils the barrel, soon? Perhaps she was once a delinquent high school drop out, who's now going to go back to her old high school to be a teacher?5 ......Seriously, canÅft she just go back there? 5 Reference to the drama Drop-out teacher returns to school (Yankee Bokou ni Kaeru), in which a former gang member returns to his old high school as a teacher. HeÅfs an enthusiastic teacher who tries to help students graduate out into the world. 7 1-1 After some consideration, Hiratsuka sensei sighed as she exhaled a puff of smoke. "All right, let's do it this way. Rewrite your report." "Yes." And I definitely will. All right, this time I'll write a highly appropriate, inoffensive composition. Much like the blogs of gravure idols and voice actresses. Something like: Today's dinner was likeÅcÅc, curry! What's with using 'like'? There's nothing about that word that adds to the surprise of eating curry. Up until this point everything had gone as I expected. But what followed this was more than I had imagined. "However, the fact remains that your heartless words and behavior have hurt my feelings. Were you never taught not to talk to a woman about her age? As a result, you are required to join the service club. After all, wrongdoings must be punished." 8 1-1 She didn't seem very hurt, so much so that she sounded commanding. Rather, she was more perky than usual, speaking in a cheerful manner. In saying that, the word perky6 inadvertently reminds me of something elseÅcÅcmy eyes averted from reality and ended up settling on sensei's breasts pushing up from underneath her blouse. DespicableÅcÅcBut then, what kind of person delights in handing out punishments? "The service clubÅcÅcWhat do you suppose I do there?" I timidly inquired. I get the feeling they could quite possibly ask me to clean out the gutter or even worse, kidnap people. "Just follow me." Hiratsuka sensei pressed the end of her cigarette onto a densely filled ashtray and stood up. While I stayed rooted to the spot having had no explanation or introduction to what she was proposing, sensei was already at the door, looking back at me. "Oi, hurry up." With my brows knitted and a scowl on my face, I followed her. 6 (6) The word for perky in Japanese is ÅekikiÅf which rhymes with ÅechichiÅf, meaning breast (This guy is such an idiot). 9 1-2 1-2 The school building at Chiba Municipal Soubu High School has a slightly irregular shape. If you look down at it from above, it looks just like the kanji for mouth (å˚) and a lot like the katakana for (Éç). Add the little audio-visual building at the bottom, and it would complete the birdÅfs eye view of our school. The building that contains the classrooms is on the side of the road and lies opposite to the special building. A passageway on the second floor links the two buildings, forming the square shape. The space enclosed by the school building in all four directions is the holy courtyard for the riajuu1 . During lunchtime, both boys and girls eat lunch there together. Then, they play badminton to help digest. After school, with the last light of the sunset on the school building as a backdrop, they talk about love and watch the stars as a salty sea breeze blows over them. Are you kidding me? From an outsiderÅfs perspective, it looks like theyÅfre actors in a youth drama trying their best to play their respective roles. The thought can only make me shudder. In such a drama, IÅfd probably play the ÅetreeÅf or something. As Hiratsuka sensei click-clacked on the linoleum floor, it seemed as though she was headed toward the special building. I have a bad feeling about this. 1 Refer to the prologue. 10 1-2 For starters, something called the 'service club' can't be any good. The word 'service' here wouldn't be used in an everyday situation; rather the use of this term would only be permitted in a restrictive sense. Like, for example, when referring to the kind of service a maid provides for her master2 . If it was this kind of 'service', itÅfd be a real turn on and youÅfd really want to go 'Letsu Party!'3 . But in reality, such a thing wouldn't happen. No, actually, if you pay a set price it would be possible. And if money can buy anything you want, even this kind of thing, then I don't have any dreams or aspirations in such a rotten world. In any case, 'service' isnÅft something good. What's more, we had already reached the special building. I'll definitely have to do stuff like move the piano from the music room, clean out the raw scraps from the biology lab or sort out the books in the library or something along those lines. In that case, I'll have to take precautions in advance. ÅgI have this chronic disease in my lower backÅcÅcwhich is, herÅcherÅcherpes? Yeah, that's itÅcÅcÅh ÅgI think you're referring to hernia. However, there's no need for your worry. What I'm asking you to do is not manual labor.Åh Hiratsuka sensei regarded me with an exceedingly contemptuous expression. 2 The service described here is sexual. 3 In this context, heÅfs referring to the desire to have sex. This is a line often said by Date Masamune from the game Sengoku BASARA. ItÅfs a colloquial phrase often used when expressing your enthusiasm to do something. 11 1-2 Well then. Is it research, or some other kind of deskwork? That kind of work means a mindless job that's more intense than manual labor. It's similar to the torture of filling a hole in the ground, only to dig it out again. ÅgI have this illness where I die upon entering a classroom.Åh ÅgWhat long-nosed sniper does that remind me of? The one from the Straw Hat Pirates?4 Åh So you read shounen manga? Well, I don't mind laboriously doing work by myself. If I flip a switch in my mind, making it clear that I am a machine, there would be no problem. And in the end, I would pursue a mechanical body only to become a bolt.5 ÅgWe're here.Åh The classroom sensei had stopped in front of was not unusual. There was nothing written on the doorplate. As I was staring at it in wonder, sensei opened the sliding door with a clatter. There were chairs and tables piled up in cluttered stacks along the edge. 4 Reference to Usopp from the manga One Piece. 5 Reference to the manga Galaxy 999 Express in which the protagonist, Testuro, aims to obtain a mechanical body to live an eternal life. Queen Promethuem, however, plans to transfer his consciousness to a bolt. 12 1-2 Perhaps it was being used as a storage room. In comparison to other classrooms, there was nothing else special about its contents apart from that. It was an exceedingly normal classroom. However, what was most obviously distinct from everything else in the room, was a single girl. By the light of the sunset, she was reading a book. Even if the world had ended, she would still most certainly be sitting there, reading. That was the illusion she gave, so much so, that it was like a scene from a painting. The moment I saw it, both my mind and my body froze. I was inadvertently fascinated by it. Realizing there were visitors, she placed a bookmark in her paperback book and looked up. ÅgHiratsuka sensei. I thought I told you to knock before you enterÅcÅh Elegant features. Long, flowing ebony hair. Wearing a uniform that should be the same as the group of girls from my class, but still looks entirely different. ÅgEven if I do knock, you never respond.Åh ÅgThat's because you enter before I have time to respond.Åh She gave a disapproving look in response to Hiratsuka sensei's words. ÅgAnd who is that airhead with you?Åh She gave me a quick once-over with a cold look in her eyes. 13 1-2 I know this girl. It's Yukinoshita Yukino - Grade 11, Class J. Obviously, I only know her by name and by face - I've never talked to her before. There's no way I would have, because I seldom ever have conversations with people at school. At Soubu High School, apart from the nine standard classes, there is one class aimed at nurturing talented students capable of fulfilling an active role in the international arena. This class has an academic standard that is two to three times better than the other classes. It mostly consists of students returning to Japan from overseas or students who have aspirations to study abroad. Among such a class, the one student that is prominent, or rather, naturally draws people's attention and stands out brilliantly, is Yukinoshita Yukino. Whether it's a regular exam or a placement exam, she is a high achiever who consistently sits at the top of our grade. Simply put, she is virtually the most perfect and beautiful girl in school and everyone knows who she is. On the other hand, I am just your average, completely mediocre student. That's why, even if she doesn't know me, I'm not offended in any way. Although, I was a little bit hurt that she used the word 'airhead'. Hurt enough to distract myself with the thought that there used to be a candy by that name and that I haven't seen it around lately. ÅgThis is Hikigaya. He's looking to join the club.Åh 14 1-2 Prompted by Hiratsuka sensei, I nodded in acknowledgement. At this point it's probably time to segue into a self-introduction. ÅgI'm Hikigaya Hachiman - Grade 11, Class F. UmÅcHeyÅcWhat do you mean by join?Åh Looking to join what? Join this club? Sensei began to talk. Had she already guessed what I was going to say? ÅgYou must engage in this club's activities as a penalty. I won't allow any disagreement, objection, protest, questions or retorts. Cool down for a bit. Reflect on your actions!Åh Without allowing me any room to protest, she declared her verdict with great resolution. ÅgWith that being said, you can probably tell by looking, but his heart is considerably corrupt. As a result, he's a pitiable, lonely person.Åh So you really can tell by just looking? Sensei turned to face Yukinoshita and said, ÅgIf he could learn how to be sociable he might just clean up his act a little. Can I leave him to you? I'm requesting that you straighten out his corrupt, reclusive disposition.Åh ÅgIf that's how it is, I think it would be a good idea if you beat and kick discipline into him,Åh Yukinoshita replied grudgingly. ÅcÅcWhat a scary woman. 15 1-2 ÅgI would if it was something I could do, but lately IÅfve been having some problems myself. Also, physical violence isn't permitted.Åh ÅcIt's like she's saying psychological violence is completely okay. ÅgI respectfully decline. That boy's lecherous eyes are filled with hidden intent that makes me feel that my life is in danger.Åh Yukinoshita set about readjusting her collar, which was not particularly out of place to begin with, and glared at me. I'm not looking at that extremely modest chest of yoursÅcÅcWait, am I? No, no I'm not, I'm really not looking. It just entered my line of sight for a bit and I was momentarily distracted. ÅgDon't worry, Yukinoshita. Since his eyes and heart are both corrupt, he is quite adept at self-preservation and calculating the trade-off between the benefits and risks of doing something. He would never do something that would result in a criminal charge. You can trust his petty thug nature.Åh ÅgThat's not a compliment at allÅcAren't you mistaken? It's not about selfpreservation and analyzing risk-benefits, I'd rather you just say that I'm capable of making sensible judgements.Åh ÅgA petty thugÅc..I seeÅcÅc,Åh Yukinoshita said. ÅgYou're not even listening to me and you ended up agreeing with herÅcÅh 16 1-2 Was Hiratsuka sensei successful in persuading her or did my petty thug nature win her trust? No matter which way it was, Yukinoshita had come to see me as everything I didn't want to be seen as. ÅgWell, if it's a request from sensei, I can't very well refuseÅcÅcI accept.Åh Yukinoshita said with incredible distaste. Sensei smiled with satisfaction. ÅgOkay. Then, I'll leave the rest to you.Åh And with that, she left the room with haste. I was left standing there alone. 17 1-3 1-3 Honestly, I would be feeling a whole lot less stressed if they had just let left me by myself. Being in an isolated environment, as I usually am, would make me feel more at ease. The sound of the clock's second hand was so dreadfully slow that I could hear it tick loudly. Hey, wait, is this for real? A sudden romantic comedy development? An incredible blanket of tension just came over the room. I had no complaints about the situation. Suddenly, I recalled a bittersweet memory from junior high school. It's after school. There are two students alone in a classroom. The curtains sway with the light breeze, and as the rays of the setting sun stream through, a young boy gathers his courage and confesses. I can still clearly remember that girl's voice. 'Can't we just be friends?' Ah no, this is a bad memory. We never even spoke again after that let alone stayed friends. Thanks to that, I ended up wondering if friendship was a relationship in which people didnÅft have even have conversations with each other. Well, the point is, being alone together with a beautiful girl in a locked room like some kind of romantic comedy would never happen to me in real life. Now that IÅfm highly trained, there's no way I would fall into such a trap. 18 1-3 Girls are shown to be interested in hotties and popular people. They also engage in impure relationships with them. The thought of it made me snigger. In other words, they are my enemies. Up until now, I've endeavored to make sure that I would never experience that again. The quickest way to avoid getting caught up in a romantic comedy development is by being hated. Lose the battle to win the war. I'll do anything to protect my pride so I don't need things like popularity! That said, in lieu of a greeting, I decided to intimidate Yukinoshita by scowling at her. Wild beasts kill with their eyes! Grrrrr Ñü! In response, Yukinoshita glanced at me like I was a piece of trash. She narrowed her large eyes as if to half-close them and let out a cold sigh. Then, with a voice like the murmuring of a clear stream, she spoke to me. ÅgÅcÅcHow about you stop standing there, making those disgusting growling noises, and just sit down?Åh ÅgHuh? Oh, yeah. Sorry.Åh 19 1-3 ÅcÅcWoah, what was with those eyes just now? A wild beast? They would have certainly killed five people. Just like how that singer, Matsushima Tomoko, got caught in that leopard's mouth.1 Did I just end up instinctively and unconsciously apologizing to her? Even without me intentionally trying to intimidate her, Yukinoshita had regarded me with hostility. Deeply unnerved, I pulled up an empty chair and sat down. Afterwards, Yukinoshita didn't show me an ounce of concern. At some point in time, the paperback book had been opened again. The sound of the pages flipping ensued. I couldn't tell what she was reading by the cover, but I figured it must have been some kind of literary work. Something like Salinger, Hemingway or Tolstoy. That's the kind of impression she gave. Yukinoshita is like some kind of noble much in the way that she is an honor student and also because no matter what, she would always be a beautiful girl. But as is normal for such elite people, Yukinoshita Yukino is cut off from any social circles. Just like her name, yuki no shita no yuki (The snow beneath the snow), however beautiful she is, she is untouchable and unobtainable. The only thing one can do is ponder her beauty. Honestly, I never thought that through this absurd turn of events, I could be acquainted with her. I'm sure if I boasted about it to my friends, they'd be jealous. Even though I don't have friends I could boast to. 1 Matsushima Tomoko is a Japanese singer who was attacked by both a lion and a leopard when she went to Kenya to film for a variety show. 20 1-3 And so, what should I do with Miss Beautiful, here? ÅgIs something wrong?Åh It was probably because I was staring at her for too long, but Yukinoshita furrowed her brows in displeasure and stared right back at me. ÅgAh, my bad. I was thinking about what I should do about all this.Åh ÅgAbout what?Åh ÅgWell I mean, it's just that I was brought here with nothing but a confusing explanation.Åh In place of a Åetsk-tskÅf, she expressed her annoyance by vehemently snapping her book shut. Then after glaring at me with her eyes, as though I was a mere bug, she breathed a sigh of resignation and uttered a few words. ÅgÅcÅcI suppose you're right. Then let's play a game.Åh ÅgA game?Åh 21 1-3 ÅgYes. A game which requires you to guess what kind of club this is. So then, what kind of club is this?Åh A game with a beautiful girl in a locked roomÅc.. I can only feel that there is some kind of erotic element to this, however the vibes she was giving off weren't light-hearted, but rather like that of a sharpened knife. So sharp that I wondered if my life would end if I lost. Where did that romantic comedy atmosphere go? Isn't this more like Kaiji?2 Giving into the pressure, I began to run a cold sweat as I surveyed the inside of the room, trying to find a clue. ÅgAre there any other club members?Åh ÅgNo, there aren't.Åh Is this club even able to continue as a club? I highly doubt it. To put it plainly, there are no hints. No, wait. On the contrary, there has been nothing but hints. Not to boast but ever since I was little I was extremely good at one-player games, having few friends. 2 Kaiji is a manga about the art of gambling. 22 1-3 23 1-3 I have quite a bit of confidence in gamebooks3 and riddles. I think I could even win in one of those high school quiz shows. Well if it's a club that can't recruit other members, then other members canÅft participate. There are a lot of things I can gather from this. If I organize my thoughts from the beginning, the answer should become obvious. ÅgA literary club?Åh ÅgReally...? Your reason being?Åh Yukinoshita questioned with great interest. "The peculiar setting, the lack of any need for special equipment and that despite the fact that there aren't enough members the club hasn't been abolished. In other words, itÅfs a club that doesn't require any expenses. In addition, you were reading a book. The answer was apparent from the start." Flawless reasoning, if I do say so myself. Even without an elementary school kid with glasses saying 'Wah...really?' and giving me hints, something like this was a piece of cake.4 It would even make Miss Yukino show some admiration and say 'I see...' with a small huff. "Incorrect." Yukinoshita gave a short and scornful laugh. 3 A Åechoose your own adventureÅf book. 4 Reference to the child detective Conan from the manga Detective Conan, and his famous phrase 24 1-3 Åc..Now, this is getting on my nerves. Who the hell said you were the irreproachable, perfect superman? YouÅfre more like the demon superman.5 ÅgThen what kind of club is this?Åh Despite the irritation in my voice, Yukinoshita made no motion that she was bothered by it. She made it clear that the game would continue. ÅgAll right, IÅfll give you the biggest hint. My being here, doing what I am, is the clubÅfs activities.Åh Finally she gives me a hint. But it isnÅft related to the answer at all. Eventually IÅfll just end up arriving at the same conclusion as before ? a literary club. No, wait. Just wait a minute and calm down. Cool it. Be cool, Hikigaya Hachiman. She said Åethere arenÅft any other club members apart from me.Åf Yet the club is still functioning. In other words, does that mean there are phantom members? Then the twist in the story would be that the phantom members really are phantoms. And in the very end, my romantic comedy would be slated to develop between a beautiful phantom girl and me. 5 Reference to the chojin (superhumans) of the manga Kinnikuman. 25 1-3 ÅgAn occult research society!Åh ÅgI told you it was a clubÅcÅh ÅgO-occult research club!Åh ÅgWrongÅcÅcThatÅfs ridiculous. Ghosts donÅft exist.Åh Without displaying the least bit of cuteness by saying something like ÅeB-because you know, they really donÅft exist! IÅfm not saying that because IÅfm scared or something!Åf she used all her power to look at me with the most scornful eyes. They were the kind of eyes that said ÅeIdiots should die.Åf ÅgI give up. I don't have a clue.Åh 26 1-4 1-4 As if IÅfd figure it out with just that. You shouldÅfve made it simpler. Something like, ÅeThere is a flood of tears above but a blazing house fire below, why?Åf1 Wouldn't that be because your house is actually on fire? At any rate, this isnÅft a guessing game but a riddle. ÅgHikigaya-kun. How many years has it been since youÅfve talked to a girl?Åh She went ahead and asked such a sudden and irrelevant question to shatter my line of reasoning. Some nerve this girl has. IÅfm pretty confident in my ability to retain information. I can remember the kind of trivial conversations that most people would forget - to the point where the girls in my class treated me like a stalker. According to my superior hippocampus, the last time I talked to a girl was two years ago in June. Girl: ÅeItÅfs pretty hot today huh?Åf Me: ÅeMore like humid, donÅft you think?Åf Girl: ÅeWhat?...ÅcOhÅcUmÅcyeah, I guessÅf 1 This is a play on a Japanese riddle which asks ÅeThere is a flood above but a blazing fire below, what am I?Åf The answer is a bathtub. The joke is that youÅfre crying because your house is actually on fire. (Too difficult to translate =.=) 27 1-4 End. It went something like that. Well except for the fact that she wasnÅft actually talking to me but to the girl sitting diagonally behind me. Humans more often remember unpleasant memories. Even now, every time I recall that incident in the middle of the night, I get the urge to pull the covers over my head and scream. Just as I was reliving that horrendous incident, Yukinoshita made a loud proclamation. ÅgThose that possess much are motivated by charity to give to those who do not. People call this volunteer work. Providing development assistance to developing countries, organizing soup-runs for the homeless, allowing an unpopular boy the opportunity to talk to a girl. Extending a helping hand to those in need. That is what this club does.Åh At some point, Yukinoshita had stood up. Naturally, she was looking down at me. ÅgWelcome to the service club. I invite you.Åh The fact that she didnÅft sound very welcoming was apparent by the way she said it straight to my face. That made me a little teary-eyed. She just kept rubbing salt onto my wounds, depressing me even further. ÅgAccording to Hiratsuka sensei, it is the duty of those who are superior to save those who lead a pitiable existence. 28 1-4 I will make sure that I accomplish what she requested of me and fulfill this responsibility. I will rectify your problem. Show some gratitude.Åh Perhaps what sheÅfs alluding to is Åenoblesse obligeÅf. A French phrase referring to the moral obligation of the noble to display honorable and generous conduct. Yukinoshita standing there with her arms folded certainly spelled nobility. In fact, it wouldnÅft be an exaggeration to call her noble, considering her grades and her outward appearance. ÅgThis bitchÅcÅcÅh But, I must say no more. I ought to wield all the words I have at my disposal to explain that I am not one to be pitied. ÅgÅc. You know, even though itÅfs me saying it, IÅfm actually fairly superior myself. I ranked third in the Japanese Proficiency exam! IÅfm pretty good-looking! If you disregard the fact that I donÅft have a girlfriend or any friends, IÅfm basically top of the line.Åh ÅgThough IÅfm sure I heard you mention a fatal flaw towards the endÅcIn a way, itÅfs amazing you can say all that so confidently. YouÅfre a weirdo. IÅfm already creeped out.Åh ÅgShut up. I donÅft want to hear that from a weird girl like you.Åh 29 1-4 She really is weird. At least that is what the rumors say. Rumors that I just happened to hear since I donÅft recall ever talking to someone. They say that Yukinoshita is very different from the girl she appears to be. That probably means sheÅfs a so-called cool beauty. And right now she wore a cold smile. To use a better descriptive word, a sadistic smile. ÅgHmÅcBased on my observations, it seems that your loneliness is a result of your corrupt mind and cynical temperament.Åh Yukinoshita concluded, eagerly. ÅgFirstly, I will find a place for you in society. Given that youÅfre so pitiable, I just canÅft leave you alone. Did you know? Just by finding a place to belong in, one can escape the tragic fate of burning up to produce a star.Åh Åg ÅeThe NighthawkÅfs StarÅf2 , right? ThatÅfs pretty nerdy.Åh If I wasnÅft the culturally aware prodigy who placed third in the Japanese Proficiency exam, I wouldnÅft have gotten that reference. Also, since itÅfs a story I like, I remember it well. It was so tragic that I actually cried. ItÅfs the kind of story that is well liked by everyone. In response to my retort, YukinoshitaÅfs eyes widened in surprise. ÅgÅc..IÅfm astonished. I never imagined that a below average high school boy would read the works of Miyazawa Kenji.Åh ÅgDid you just belittle me?Åh 2 The NighthawkÅfs Star is a Japanese fable about a bird called Nighthawk who is ridiculed for his ugliness. He yearns to fly far away and as a result, he dies. Afterwards his body becomes a beautiful light that produces an ever-shining star. 30 1-4 ÅgIÅfm sorry. That may have been a bit of an exaggeration. Just short of average is probably the correct thing to say.Åh ÅgDonÅft you mean a bit too much of an exaggeration?! DidnÅft you hear me say I ranked third in the grade?!Åh ÅgTo be full of yourself just because you ranked third once is pathetic. Considering the results of an examination in one subject as indicative of oneÅfs sharp intellect is also pathetic.Åh Åc.This girl. There is a limit to how rude one can be. For her to be treating a guy she just met as belonging to an inferior race, I must only have as much knowledge as the Prince of all Saiyans.3 ÅgAlthough, ÅeThe NighthawkÅfs starÅf suits you perfectly. Take for example, the NighthawkÅfs physical appearance.Åh ÅgAre you saying that my face is disfigured?....Åh ÅgThatÅfs not what IÅfm trying to say. IÅfm just saying that sometimes the truth hurtsÅcÅh ÅgAren't you practically saying the same thing?!Åh 3 Reference to Prince Vegeta from the manga Dragon Ball who is known more for his fighting abilities than his intelligence. 31 1-4 At this point, Yukinoshita took on a serious expression as she rested her hand on my shoulder. ÅgYou should not look away from the truth. Look into a mirror to see reality.Åh ÅgHey, just wait a minute. Though it might be me saying it, my features are quite handsome. Enough to have my sister tell me, ÅeOnii-chan, if only you didnÅft talk at allÅcÅf Which is virtually the same as saying, the only thing good about me is my looks.Åh As expected of my sister. She has a good eye. Which, on the contrary, is something that the girls in this school lack! Yukinoshita placed a hand on her temple as though she had a headache. ÅgAre you an idiot? Beauty is not something that can be decided about oneself subjectively. In other words, as we are the only two people in this room, my objective opinion is the only correct opinion.Åh ÅgD-despite being confusing, somehow your argument makes senseÅcÅh ÅgTo start with, eyes such as yours which emulate those of a rotten fish, would invariably leave a bad impression. IÅfm not criticizing your facial features but rather your facial expression, which is unattractive. It is proof of your considerably twisted nature.Åh 32 1-4 As she talked, YukinoshitaÅfs face was certainly cute, but on the inside, it was different. The look in her eyes was comparable to that of a criminal. She and I both lack any cutesy charm. ÅcÅcBut despite that, do my eyes really look like those of a fish? If I was a girl I could interpret it as a plus saying, ÅeWhat? Do I really look like the Little Mermaid?Åf Just as I was busy distracting myself with my musings, Yukinoshita flipped her hair over her shoulder and said, as if in triumph, ÅgThe point is, being self-confident in superficial aspects such as grades or physical appearance is unappealing. Not to mention those rotten eyes of yours.Åh ÅgEnough with the eyes already!Åh ÅgYes, I suppose even if I say any more than this, it wonÅft change anything.Åh ÅgYou can start by apologizing to my parents.Åh I could feel my face twitch in anticipation of her response. It soon appeared that even YukinoshitaÅfs expression became despondent as she reflected on her words. ÅgI certainly said some horrible things. It must be painful for your parents.Åh 33 1-4 ÅgPlease just stop, itÅfs my fault. No, itÅfs my faceÅfs fault.Åh I entreated, on the verge of getting teary-eyed. Finally, Yukinoshita put an end to her steely words. I quickly realized that it was useless saying anything. And as I became immersed in a vision of myself sitting at the foot of BuddhaÅfs tree, meditating with the aim to attain enlightenment, Yukinoshita continued conversation. ÅgWell then, that completes this conversation simulation. If you can converse with a girl like me, then you should be able to talk to just about anybody.Åh Smoothing her hair with her right hand, Yukinoshita gave an expression that was brimming with a sense of accomplishment. Then she smiled pleasantly. ÅgNow you have this spectacular memory to hold in your heart that will keep you going even when youÅfre alone.Åh ÅgIsnÅft that solution just wishful thinking on your part?Åh ÅgBut if thatÅfs so, then it wouldnÅft fulfill senseiÅfs request...I have approach it on an elementary levelÅclike for example, having you stop school.Åh ÅgThat isnÅft a solution. ThatÅfs just like covering up a stench.Åh4 ÅgAh, so you are aware of the fact that you're a nuisance?Åh5 4 A Japanese idiom meaning to hide a failure or an inconvenience through underhanded means. 5 By Åethe stenchÅf, Yukinoshita is actually saying that he is aware of the fact that he Åes a ÅenuisanceÅf. The Japanese word for something that smells bad (kusaimono) could also refer to someone who is a ÅenuisanceÅf. This leads to the following joke he makes. 34 1-4 "Is that why I receive these foul glares and people avoid me?Åh I attempted to respond with a play on words, but to no avail. ÅgÅcSo annoying.Åh After I laughed at my somewhat witty remark, Yukinoshita glared at me as if to say ÅeWhy are you even alive?Åf Like I said, her eyes were scary. Then a silence descended upon the room ? enough to make my ears hurt. Actually it was probably also because I let Yukinoshita say whatever she wanted that my ears hurt. However, the silence was soon shattered, as the door was violently pulled open with a resounding clatter. 35 1-5 1-5 ÅgYukinoshita. IÅfm coming in.Åh ÅgI told you to knockÅcÅh Yukinoshita sighed. ÅgSorry, sorry. Don't mind me and just continue as you were. I just thought IÅfd stop by and see how youÅfre doing.Åh Hiratsuka sensei gave Yukinoshita a generous smile, and leaned against the classroom wall. She then looked back and forth between Yukinoshita and me. ÅgItÅfs nice that you two are getting along with each other.Åh What made you draw that conclusion? ÅgHikigaya, keep up the good work and focus on straightening out that cynical temperament and curing those rotten eyes of yours. IÅfll be heading back now. Just make sure you head home before the end of the school day.Åh ÅgP-please just wait a second!Åh I grabbed senseiÅfs hand in an attempt to stop her. In that instant- ÅgOw! Owwwww! I give up! I give up!Åh 36 1-5 She had me in an armlock. After I frantically tapped out and admitted defeat, she finally let me go. ÅgOh it was just you Hikigaya. DonÅft just carelessly stand behind me because IÅfll instinctively unleash my powerful techniques on you.Åh ÅgWhat are you, Golgo1 ? Besides, arenÅft you the careless one? DonÅft do that so suddenly!Åh ÅgArenÅft you demanding?...Anyway, whatÅfs the problem?Åh ÅgThe problem is you....what do you mean by Åestraighten outÅf? DoesnÅft that make me sound like a juvenile delinquent? Just what the hell is this all about?Åh Hiratsuka sensei rubbed her chin thoughtfully for a moment. ÅgDidnÅft Yukinoshita explain it to you? Basically, the main aim of this club is to help people solve their problems by encouraging self-improvement. I guide students who I believe require self-improvement to this club. You can think of it as the Hyperbolic Time Chamber2 . Or perhaps Revolutionary Girl Utena3 , if that makes it easier to understand.Åh 1 Reference to Golgo 13 from the manga Golgo 13. Golgo 13 is a professional assassin. 2 Reference to the place of the name in the manga Dragon Ball. Characters use it in order to undergo intense training as one year in the chamber equates to one day in the real world. 3 Reference to the manga Revolutionary Girl Utena. 37 1-5 ÅgIt made it even more difficult to understand and just illustrates how old you are.Åh ÅgWhat did you just say?Åh ÅgÅc.Nothing at all.Åh I murmured retreating into myself after being shot by the terribly frosty expression she gave me. Hiratsuka sensei sighed as she observed me. ÅgYukinoshita. It appears that youÅfre having a hard time straightening him out.Åh ÅgThatÅfs because he himself isnÅft aware of the fact that he has a problem.Åh Yukinoshita replied coldly in response to senseiÅfs troubled expression. ÅcÅcThis feelingÅc.I just canÅft stand to be here another second. It feels similar to the time when my parents found out about my porn stash in sixth grade and kept lecturing me about it. No, probably not that bad. ÅgUmÅcyouÅfve been saying nonsensical stuff about straightening me out and improvement and reformation and revolutionary girls and whatnot for a while now, but I never really asked for any of itÅcÅh 38 1-5 Hiratsuka sensei cocked her head slightly in confusion. ÅgHm?Åh ÅgÅcWhat are you saying? If you donÅft change, youÅfll be at a level thatÅfll make living in society difficult.Åh Yukinoshita looked at me as if her argument was as justified as saying ÅeWar is fruitless. Lay down your arms.Åf ÅgIt appears that your humanity is severely inferior to that of others. DonÅft you want to change that part of yourself?Åh ÅgThatÅfs not itÅc.I donÅft want people who keep harping on about making me change, telling me who I am. Generally, to change yourself at the word of another would mean that you wouldnÅft be yourself anymore right? It is said that the self isÅcÅh ÅgThe self is such that it cannot be viewed by oneself objectively.Åh My attempt at sounding impressive by ripping a saying off Descartes was intercepted by Yukinoshita...Even though I was about to say something pretty good. ÅgYouÅfre just running away from the problem. If you donÅft change, you wonÅft move forward.Åh Yukinoshita said, cutting me down with her harsh words. Why has she been so hostile and snappy the whole time? Are her parents crabs or something? ÅgWhatÅfs wrong with running away? DonÅft keep telling me to change like an idiot who only knows one thing. 39 1-5 If youÅfre like that then do you do things like face the sun and say, ÅeThe westering sun is too intense and everybodyÅfs bothered by it so please set in the east from now on.Åh ÅgThatÅfs fallacy. Please donÅft stray from the issue at hand. The sun does not move - it is the Earth that moves. DonÅft you know the heliocentric theory?Åh ÅgThat was just a figure of speech! If that was fallacy then what youÅfre saying is also fallacy. By changing, in the end IÅfd be changing in order to run away from the problem. So whoÅfs running away from the problem now? If I really wasnÅft running away from the problem, I wouldnÅft change and just stay right where I am. Why canÅft you just accept my past and the way am I now?Åh ÅgÅc.If thatÅfs how it is, it wouldnÅft solve any problems or save anybody.Åh As Yukinoshita spoke the word ÅesaveÅf, her expression was that of bloodcurdling anger. I inadvertently flinched. I was on the verge of apologizing by blurting out a ÅeS-s-s-s-sorry!Åf if needed be. Talking about salvation isnÅft usually something a mere high school student would do. I just canÅft understand what it is that is driving her this far. ÅgBoth of you just calm down.Åh Hiratsuka senseiÅfs calm tone eased what was to become, or rather, what had been an unpleasant atmosphere from the very start. Just by looking at her grinning face, you could tell that she was full of anticipation and delight. ÅgThings have become interesting. I love developments like these. ItÅfs like JUMP4 , which is nice donÅft you think?Åh 4 A line of manga magazines aimed at boys. 40 1-5 Somehow, sensei was the only one who was ecstatic. Even though she was female, her eyes were like those of a young boy. ÅgSince before ancient times, when two collide in the name of justice, it is customary in shounen manga to battle it out in an all or nothing match.Åh ÅgBut weÅfre not in a shounen mangaÅcÅh Nobody paid attention to me. As sensei let out a resounding laugh, she turned to us and made a loud announcement. ÅgWell then letÅfs do it this way. From now on, I will guide troubled lambs to this club where they will be under your supervision. The both of you will try and help them as you see fit. And it would be good if you prove your moral righteousness to each other to the best of your ability. Who can help these people?! Gundam Fight. Ready, Go!!Åh5 ÅgI refuse.Åh Yukinoshita declared, bluntly rejecting her proposition. Her eyes harbored the same coldness that had been directed at me only a little while ago. Well, since I agreed with her, I nodded in assent. Not to mention that G Gundam isnÅft from our generation. After sensei had registered our unwillingness, she bit her nails in frustration. ÅgTch, maybe a Robattle5 would have been easier to understandÅcÅh 5 Reference to the RPG Medabots. A robattle is an activity in which one medafighter fights another with his/her medabot. 41 1-5 ÅgThatÅfs not the problemÅcÅh Games like ÅeMedabotsÅf are too geekyÅcÅc ÅgSensei. Please stop acting childishly hyperactive. It is unbecoming of someone your age and itÅfs awfully indecent.Åh Yukinoshita hurled ice-cold sharp words like they were icicles. It wasnÅft clear if sensei had calmed down or not, but in an instant senseiÅfs face was colored pink in embarrassment. She cleared her throat so as to cover up her faux pas. ÅgIn-in any case! The only thing that will prove oneÅfs rectitude is their actions! If I said you must have a match, then you will have a match. Neither of you have the right to say no.Åh ÅgThatÅfs too tyrannicalÅc.Åh SheÅfs exactly like a kid! The only part of her thatÅfs adult like is her chest. Well, in something as stupid as a battle IÅfd lose for fun. Hah. But getting a star for my efforts wouldnÅft be so bad. To say that thereÅfs meaning in participating in such a thing is a convenient and overly extravagant thing to say. Nonetheless, the overly detestable woman child6 with a mind full of shounen manga was still spouting absurd remarks. 6 The original word used here is roribaba, which refers to a woman who acts and looks like a little girl but is actually a lot older. 42 1-5 ÅgIn order for you to fight with your utmost desperate efforts, IÅfll provide a little motivation. How about, the winner can command the loser to do anything they wish?Åh ÅgAbsolutely anything?!Åh By anything, it must mean that right? It canÅft be anything but that anythingÅc.gulp. Suddenly, the sound of a chair being pulled back could be heard. Yukinoshita had moved back two meters, embracing her body as she took a defensive position. ÅgCompeting against this boy makes me feel that my chastity is in peril. I refuse.Åh ÅgPrejudice! ItÅfs not as if all second year high school boys only think about obscene stuff!Åh There are a lot of other things like, uhÅc.IÅfm thinking! Åc..world peace? Stuff like that? Other than that, thereÅfs not much else I think about. ÅgSo even Yukinoshita Yukino is fearful of somethingÅc.Are you that afraid youÅfll lose?Åh Hiratsuka said with a malicious face. Yukinoshita appeared a little offended at that. ÅgÅc.Fine. Although, IÅfm a little annoyed that I must give in to such cheap provocation. I accept. While weÅfre at it, IÅfll let you deal with that boy, also. Åh 43 1-5 Woah, YukinoshitaÅfs a sore loser. How is she the type that hates to lose, you ask? The fact that she basically said ÅeI can see right through your intentionsÅf like someone who hates to lose. I mean, what does she mean by Åedeal withÅf? YouÅfre scary already so just stop it. Hiratsuka sensei grinned broadly, ignoring YukinoshitaÅfs gaze. ÅgThen itÅfs decided.Åh ÅgHey, you havenÅft asked me if I acceptÅc.Åh ÅgOne look at that grin on your face and I saw no point in asking you.Åh I seeÅc. ÅgI will decide the winner of this match. Of course, the decision will be influenced by my opinion and bias. DonÅft think about it too much and just act accordinglyÅc.in an appropriate and proper manner and do your best.Åh Having uttered these words, Hiratsuka sensei left the room, leaving only a very cross Yukinoshita and I behind. Of course, thereÅfs nothing to talk about. While remaining motionless in that silent room, a sound like that of a broken radio resounded. It was sign that a chime was about to ring. Indeed, after a synthesized chime had sounded, Yukinoshita suddenly closed her book. It seemed that the chime indicated the end of the school day. 44 1-5 With that as a signal, Yukinoshita quickly set about getting her things together to go home. After she had carefully put her book in her bag, she stood up. Then, she gave me a fleeting glance. And with just that and not a word, she left. Without even a Åesee you tomorrowÅf or a ÅegoodbyeÅf, she had briskly walked out. I didnÅft even get the chance to call her out on her exceedingly cold reception. And there I was all-alone, the only one left in that room. Was today an unlucky day or something? I got called to the teacherÅfs lounge, was forced to join a mysterious club and got verbally abused by a girl whose good looks are wasted on the only cute part of her ? her face. IÅfve sustained some considerably extensive damage. IsnÅft talking to a girl supposed to make you more excited? My heart only sank in despair. If itÅfs going to be like this, then talking to stuffed animals everyday would be a lot better. They donÅft talk back and they always smile brightly at you. Why wasnÅft I born a hardcore masochist? And on top of that, why am I forced to compete in such a pointless match? With Yukinoshita as my opponent, I donÅft think I can win. I wonder if something like a match would generally be considered part of club activities. When I think of club activities, something like what those girl bands do on those DVDs would be just right. With things continuing as they are now, will we ever be able to get along? Not likely. 45 1-5 SheÅfd probably command me in that unconcerned manner by saying something like, ÅeYour breath smells, so could you stop breathing for at least three hours?Åf As I expected, youth is full of nothing but lies. After losing a baseball tournament during their third year, they shed tears to make themselves seem beautiful. After failing their college entrance exam, they insist that their failure is simply a life experience. After failing to confess to the person they like, they withdraw. They deceive themselves by feigning ignorance, saying that they were thinking about that personÅfs happiness. And then thereÅfs that. Anticipating a romantic comedy with an unsociable, irritating so-called tsundere7 girl that is never going to happen. My essay does not require any amendments. As I expected; youth is a pretence, a deceptive word, and fraudulent. 7 Tsundere is a term used for someone who appears cold on the outside but is in fact warm on the inside. (Tsuntsun = turn away in disgust. Deredere = lovey dovey.) 46 47 48 2-1 Chapter 2: Yukinoshita Yukino is always headstrong. As I was exiting the classroom after homeroom had finished, I spotted Hiratsuka sensei lying in wait for me. She was like a prison guard, standing completely motionless with her arms folded. In fact, if she had come dressed in military uniform and been given a whip, it would probably suit her a little too much. Well since school is pretty much like a jail, that wouldnÅft be too much of a stretch of the imagination. I mean you could compare it to Alcatraz or Cassandra1 . It would be nice if the Savior of the CenturyÅfs End would hurry up and arrive.2 ÅgHikigaya. ItÅfs time for club activities.Åh As she soon as she said that, I could suddenly feel my blood run cold. Crap. IÅfm going to be arrested. If I get escorted to the clubroom I seriously will lose all hope in my school life. Yukinoshita, a natural born stuck-up, speaks words that are sort of venomous. TheyÅfre really just abusive and not cute at all. Would you call that being a tsundere? Oh wait, that just describes a plain old bitch. But despite that, Hiratsuka sensei didnÅft give me an ounce of consideration and wore a smile of indifference. 1 Reference to the mighty prison belonging to Ken-Oh from the manga Fist of The North Star. It is also known as the ÅeCity of Wailing DemonsÅf and was used to imprison martial artists who had forfeited their ancient scrolls to Ken-Oh in his goal to create the ultimate martial art. 2 Reference to Kenshiro, the protagonist of the manga Fist of the North Star. Kenshiro protects the weak and innocent from the numerous gangs roaming the post-apocalyptic wasteland, eventually gaining his reputation as the ÅeSavior of the CenturyÅfs EndÅf. 49 2-1 ÅgLetÅfs go.Åh Hiratsuka sensei said and attempted to grab my arm. I evaded her. Without hesitating, she reached out her hand again. I barely dodged her again. ÅgUmm, you seeÅcI think that well, among other things, our education system is supposed to encourage and respect studentsÅf independenceÅcso I would like to object to the way I am being forced to do thisÅcÅh ÅgUnfortunately, schools are institutions that are designed to train students to become well-integrated citizens of society. Once you go out into society nobody is going to care about your opinion. So youÅfd better start getting used to being forced to do things.Åh As soon as sensei had said that, her fist came flying at me. She didnÅft give me a regular punch but a full-blown body blow with her clenched fist drilling into me like a screw. It was so powerful I couldnÅft breath. Then without missing a second, she stopped trying to kill me and gripped my hand instead. ÅgYou know whatÅfll happen if you try and bail again, right? DonÅft try and provoke my fist.Åh ÅgAre you really dead set on using your fistÅcÅh ThereÅfs no way the pain could get any worse. As we were walking, Hiratsuka sensei opened her mouth as though sheÅfd remembered something. 50 2-1 ÅgOh thatÅfs right. If you try to escape again you will lose the match with Yukinoshita by default. No buts allowed. In addition, you will be penalized. ItÅfd be best not to expect that you will be able to graduate in your final year.Åh There was definitely no way I was getting out of this anytime soon. Not mentally either for that matter. As the sound of her heels click clacking on the floor resounded, sensei walked beside me. To make things worse, she gripped my arm. Any other circumstance and it would have looked like sensei was a bar hostess cosplaying as a teacher who was escorting me to her cosplay cabaret. But there were three things that were different. Firstly, I wasnÅft paying her any money. Secondly, she wasnÅft actually gripping my arm but the end of my elbow. Lastly, I wasnÅft happy or excited at all. Well except for the fact that the end of my elbow was touching senseiÅfs breast. The only place sheÅfs taking me right now is that clubroom. ÅgUm, IÅfm not going to run away or anything so IÅfll be okay going by myself. I mean you know IÅfm always alone. IÅfm totally fine by myself. Or rather, if IÅfm not by myself I canÅft keep my composure.Åh ÅgDonÅft say such sad things. I want us to go together.Åh Sensei gave a soft sigh and smiled gently. It was totally different from the usual narrowed eyes she looks at me with. The difference startled me. 51 2-1 ÅgLetting you escape would be enough to make me grind my teeth. So even if I donÅft want to, IÅfll have to drag you there to ease my mental stress.Åh ÅgThatÅfs the worst excuse ever!Åh ÅgHow should I put it? Even though IÅfm absolutely fed up with all this, IÅfm still accompanying you there for the sake of straightening you out. This is what you would call a beautiful bond of love between a teacher and her student.Åh ÅgThis is love? If this is love then I donÅft need it.Åh ÅgWell that excuse just shows that you really are twisted, doesnÅft it?.....So twisted that your pressure points are reversed? Are you going to be constructing the Holy Cross Mausoleum or something?Åh3 You seriously love manga too muchÅc ÅgIf you were a little more compliant youÅfd be cuter. It canÅft be much fun looking at the world through that distorted view of yours.Åh 3 Reference to Thouzer from the manga Fist of The North Star whose organs and pressure points are reversed. Due to a traumatic event in which he killed his sensei, he disavowed all feelings of love and compassion. He then took on the title of Holy Emperor and enslaved children with his army in order to construct the Holy Cross Mausoleum, a shrine to his deceased sensei. 52 2-1 ÅgWell itÅfs not like the world is full of sunshine and daisies. If society was only shaped by the view that one must be happy-go-lucky all the time, Hollywood wouldnÅft make tear-jerking movies would they? One can find pleasure in tragedies.Åh ÅgMaking speeches like that must be pretty typical for you. Although itÅfs pretty common for young people to be cynical, for you itÅfs already an illness. An illness characteristic of eleventh graders. Yeah you really do have ÅekounibyouÅf.Åh4 Hiratsuka sensei wore a brilliant smile as she confirmed my ÅeillnessÅf. ÅgHey, isnÅft that a little too harsh? Treating me like I have an illness. I mean what the hell is ÅekounibyouÅf anyway?Åh ÅgDo you like manga and anime?Åh Ignoring my request for an explanation, she changed the subject. ÅgWell, I donÅft dislike it or anything.Åh ÅgSo why do you like it?Åh 4 ÅeKounibyouÅf (çÇìÒïa) literally translates to ÅeSecond year of high school sicknessÅf. It is characterised by a dislike of ÅechuunibyouÅf (Second year of junior high sickness) in which teenagers become overly selfconscious. 53 2-1 ÅgWell thatÅfs becauseÅcÅc.ItÅfs representative of Japanese culture. ItÅfs also a part of pop culture that is recognised as the pride of Japan. WouldnÅft it be strange if I didnÅft acknowledge that fact? Since the domestic market is becoming larger, we canÅft ignore it on an economic front either.Åh ÅgI see. How about general literature, then? Higashino Keigo and Isaka Koutarou4 and the like?Åh5 ÅgWell I have read them but honestly, I like the books they wrote before they became popular.Åh ÅgWhat are you favorite light novel publishing labels?Åh ÅgGagagaÅc.and Kodansha Box6 . Well I donÅft know if you can consider what Kodansha Box publishes as light novels though. Why are you asking me all this stuff?Åh ÅgWell. YouÅfve really met my expectations ? not in a good way. A perfect instance of kounibyou.Åh ÅgLike I said, what the hell is ÅekounibyouÅf?Åc.Åh 5 Keigo Higashino is a Japanese author chiefly known for his mystery novels. Isaka Koutarou is a Japanese author of detective fiction. 6 Gagagaga Bunko is a light novel label published by Shogakukan. Oregairu is published by them. Kodansha Box is a publishing line from the major Japanese publishing house, Kodansha. 54 2-1 ÅgKounibyou is simply Kounibyou. A common state of mind experienced by high school students. They think that being cynical is cool and always express views that are popular on the internet such as ÅeWork and you lose to the systemÅf.7 When referring to popular novelists and manga writers, they say ÅeI like the books they wrote before they became popularÅf. They mock things that everybody worships and praise those that are obscure. And on top of that, they make fun of otakus even though they are like them. While giving off an air like they understand everything, they spout twisted logic. Basically, theyÅfre unlikable.Åh ÅgUnlikableÅc. Crap! ThatÅfs pretty much spot on so I canÅft refute!Åh ÅgNo, IÅfm kind of praising you. Students are actually quite clever these days and come to terms with reality quite easily. As a teacher, itÅfs not as if I find it fun to point out your faults. I mean considering the way that IÅfm talking to you like youÅfre an adult it feels like weÅfre working right now.Åh ÅgStudents these days, huh?Åh I couldnÅft help the wry smile that crept across my face. What a clich? thing to say. Feeling kind of pissed off, I thought about responding with a slight retort. However after noticing sensei staring hard into my eyes, I just shrugged my shoulders. ÅgIt looked like you were just about to say something but it was probably something completely characteristic of someone with kounibyouÅh 7 The original Japanese expression is ÅeHataraitara makeÅf (ì≠Ç¢ÇΩÇÁïâÇØ).It is a view commonly expressed by NEETs and school students who believe there is no point in working if what you earn is less than the amount of welfare you can obtain. 55 2-1 ÅgÅc.Oh really.Åh ÅgI donÅft want you to get the wrong idea but IÅfm seriously kind of praising you. I like people who stick to their ideas. Even though they may be twisted.Åh Having her say ÅelikeÅf so suddenly could only leave me stumped for words like an idiot. I found myself worrying about trying to find a retort to counter words I wasnÅft used to hearing. ÅgBeing as twisted as you are, what do you think of Yukinoshita Yukino?Åh ÅgSheÅfs a bitch.Åh I immediately replied. I hated her so much that it was as though sensei had said ÅeI think you should give up on ÅgConcrete RoadÅh.Åf8 ÅgI see.Åh Hiratsuka sensei said with a bitter smile. ÅgAlthough, she really is an extraordinarily excellent studentÅc.Well, those who ÅehaveÅf may indeed suffer just by ÅehavingÅf. But still, she is a very sweet girl.Åh In what way? I thought, shaking my head in my mind. 8 ÅeConcrete roadÅf is a song written by Shizuku, the protagonist of the Ghibli film Whisper of the Heart. Her love interest, Seiji Amasawa, is cruel in the beginning and tells her that she should Åegive up on ÅeConcrete roadÅfÅf. After which, she mutters ÅejerkÅf under her breath numerous times all the way home. Hachiman is saying that, that is how much he hates Yukinoshita. 56 2-1 ÅgShe would certainly have some kind of ÅeillnessÅf too. SheÅfs kind and occasionally right. But society is neither kind nor righteous. IÅfm sure itÅfs a hard way to live.Åh ÅgPutting aside the fact that sheÅfs righteous and kind, IÅfm sure most of society would agree with you.Åh As soon as I said that, sensei looked at me as if to say ÅeThatÅfs what I was thinking.Åf ÅgAs I expected you are ? the both of you are quite contrary. IÅfm worried about the fact that neither of you seem like youÅfll be able to adapt to society well. ThatÅfs why I want to bring you both to the same place.Åh ÅgWould that be an isolation ward?.....Åh ÅgYeah probably. I like watching students like you two, its fun. So maybe itÅfs just that I want the both of you to be close by.Åh She laughed cheerfully. Then, like always, she had trapped me in an armlock. Both her arms locked mine around her torso so that they were held straight.9 This mixed martial arts type move was probably influenced by manga. As my elbows made this unpleasant creaking sound, they kept rubbing up against senseiÅfs huge bust. Åc..Jeez. As per usual, IÅfm finding it difficult to escape after having her pull a perfect move on me. ItÅfs vexing but it shouldn't be long before I have to just give in to this feeling. 9 Look up ÅekimedashiÅf, the sumo-wrestling move, for further information. 57 2-1 No actually IÅfm already done for. At that point I thought, since there are two breasts, ÅebustÅf should be pluralized as ÅebustsÅf. 58 2-2 2-2 Once we reached the special building, sensei finally released me. Maybe she had finally stopped worrying about me running away. Nevertheless, she kept glancing in my direction as she left me there. She didnÅft express any sentiment that was remotely compassionate by saying something like ÅeIÅfm sorry to part with youÅf or ÅeI hate to leave youÅcÅf. The only vibe she was giving off was an intense will to kill that was saying ÅeYou understand what will happen if you run away right?...Åf I smiled wryly at that as I walked down the hallway. There was dead silence at one end of the special building and the air was chilly. There should have been other clubs going on but I hadnÅft heard any noises that it indicated it as such, yet. I didnÅft know if it was because this was the special building or if it was because of her. A result of the strange aura Yukinoshita Yukino was emitting. I put my hand on the door to open it. Honestly, I was feeling depressed but on the other hand the thought of running away irritated me too. The important thing is not to let anything she says get to me. I shouldnÅft think about us being alone together. I should just think of her being there and me being there separately. If thereÅfs no relation between us, I wouldnÅft have to feel awkward and uncomfortable. 59 2-2 And so today it begins: the first way to prevent feeling scared of being alone ? ÅeIf you see a stranger, think of them as a stranger.Åf Incidentally, there isnÅft a second way. Basically, awkwardness is a result of thoughts such as ÅeIf I donÅft say somethingÅcÅf and ÅeIf I donÅft try and get along with herÅcÅf gnawing at your mind. ItÅfs the same as how someone sitting next to another person on a train wouldnÅft be thinking ÅeCrap! WeÅfre alone together! This is so awkward!Åf. If I think of it like that, I can get over this whole thing. It would be good if she was just silently reading a book or something. As I opened the clubroom door, I saw Yukinoshita sitting there reading a book in the exact same position as yesterday. ÅgÅc..Åh It was a good thing I opened the door but then I found myself wondering whether it would be a good idea to say something. Anyway, I just gave her a brief nod and moved past her. Yukinoshita just gave me a quick glance and then a second later her eyes returned to her paperback book. ÅgAt this distance, in this room ? Are you being ostracized?Åh 60 2-2 She completely ignored me and I felt like I just vanished into thin air. IsnÅft this exactly like how I feel like in the classroom? ÅgThatÅfs a strange greeting. What tribe does it originate from?Åh ÅgÅc..Good afternoon.Åh I uttered a greeting IÅfd learned in nursery school, unable to bear her caustic remark. Yukinoshita smiled in response. This is probably the first time Yukinoshita Yukino has shown me her smile. As she smiled, I learned whether or not she had dimples or a double tooth peeking out. In other words, she was cute. Something I didnÅft care about at all. ÅgGood afternoon. I thought you werenÅft going to come anymore.Åh That smile of hers was certainly foul play. It was on the same level as MaradonaÅfs ÅeHand of GodÅf.1 ÅgI-itÅfs not that big of a deal! If I didnÅft turn up IÅfd lose so thatÅfs the only reason! DdonÅft get the wrong idea!Åh This was a little like a romantic comedy type conversation. However weÅfre playing opposite roles ? itÅfs like IÅfm the girl and sheÅfs the guy. This sucks after all. I didnÅft get the feeling Yukinoshita was particularly offended by my remark. That is to say, on the other hand, she continued conversation like she didnÅft even care about my response. 1 Reference to the Argentinean soccer player Diego Maradona who scored a goal with a handball that was later called ÅeThe Hand of GodÅf. 61 2-2 ÅgWhen one is lambasted to that degree, they wouldnÅft normally come againÅc.Are you a masochist?Åh ÅgNoÅc..Åh ÅgA stalker, then?Åh ÅgWrong again. Hey, why are you assuming that IÅfve got a thing for you?Åh ÅgYou donÅft?Åh This bitch. She nonchalantly cocked her head in puzzlement and made a confused face! It was a little cute but IÅfm not buying any of it! ÅgAs if! Even IÅfm put off by that presumptuous attitude of yours.Åh ÅgYes, I was convinced that you liked me.Åh Yukinoshita said without being particularly surprised. Rather, she wore her usual, unchanging cold expression. Of course, Yukinoshita has a cute face. Cute enough that even I, who has no friends and interacts with no one in this school, know of its existence. 62 2-2 There is no room for doubt about the fact that she is one of the most beautiful girls in the school. However, her self-confident behavior is abnormal. 63 2-3 2-3 ÅgHow were you brought up to be so na?ve? Was everyday your birthday? Or was Santa Claus your lover?Åh If that werenÅft the case, her mind wouldnÅft be trapped in this delusion of happiness. If she were to keep going at this rate, it surely wouldnÅft be any different from going through a painful experience. SheÅfd better change the way sheÅfs going before she passes the point of no return. It seemed some compassion from within the deep recesses of my mind surfaced. I decided to choose my words carefully and convey the message indirectly. ÅgYukinoshita. YouÅfre abnormal. YouÅfre totally delusional. Get a lobotomy or something.Åh ÅgIs that you trying to be frank for my own good?Åh Yukinoshita chuckled and looked in my direction, but her eyes werenÅft laughing ? they were scary. But well I didnÅft say she was garbage or worthless or anything like that. She could have at least commended me for that. Frankly, if her face wasnÅft cute, IÅfm sure I would have hit her. ÅgWell, considering your low social standing you may perceive me as strange. However, itÅfs only natural that I came to think this way. 64 2-3 ItÅfs something I derived from experience.Åh Yukinoshita laughed with her shoulders pulled back proudly. The fact that even that kind of gesture could look good on Yukinoshita was a mystery. ÅgDerived from experience you sayÅc.Åh She must be alluding to experiences of a romantic kind. ItÅfs obvious if you simply consider her appearance. ÅgYouÅfre talking about your super fun school lifeÅcÅh I murmured with a sigh. ÅgYes, yes. ThatÅfs right. It would be correct to say that IÅfm actually leading quite a peaceful school life.Åg Yukinoshita responded at once. Despite that, for some reason Yukinoshita had a distant look in her eyes and her gaze was directed away from me. Thanks to that I found myself thinking that the gentle curve of the outline of her chin to her neck was beautiful. A piece of information so worthless, I could die. Upon watching her, I just realized something. Well, if I had just kept my cool I would have noticed it instantly but this natural born stuck up who puts herself on a pedestal couldnÅft possibly maintain relationships with normal people. Therefore, thereÅfs no way she would have something like a peaceful school life. Maybe I should just go ahead and askÅc. 65 2-3 ÅgHey, do you have any friends?Åh As soon as I said that, Yukinoshita turned her head. Åg....Well first explain where the definition of a friend begins and ends.Åh ÅgAh, say no more. ThatÅfs a line somebody with no friends would say.Åh Take it from me. Well, in all seriousness, I have no idea what boundaries the term ÅefriendÅf would be defined by. I wish someone would just explain to me how a friend differs from an acquaintance. Would someone you see once be a friend and someone you see everyday a sibling? Mido faado reshi sorao?1 Why is that last ÅeoÅf the only sound thatÅfs not part of the scale? That much was bothering me. To begin with, there is a fine line between the definition of a friend and an acquaintance. This is especially obvious between girls. Even people in the same class seem to be ranked and classified as classmates, friends and best friends. In that case, this is about where those differences came from. But I digress. ÅgWell since IÅfd imagined you without any friends, itÅfs fine.Åh 1 A line from theme song of the kidsÅf show ÅeDo-Re-Mi-Fa-DonutsÅf. HeÅfs referring to the fact that the original scale ÅeDo-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-TiÅf doesnÅft end in an ÅeoÅf sound but a ÅetiÅf sound. 66 2-3 ÅgI never said I didn't have any friends. Although, even if I didnÅft have friends itÅfs not as though that would be disadvantageous in any way.Åh ÅgAh yes. YouÅfre right. YouÅfre right.Åh I quickly said, evading her words as she directed scornful eyes at me. ÅgThat is to say, why is that even though youÅfre well-liked by everybody, you donÅft have any friends?Åh I asked. Yukinoshita appeared slightly miffed. After which, she averted her eyes in displeasure and spoke. ÅgÅc.You would never understand.Åh Yukinoshita puffed her cheeks a little and looked away. Well thatÅfs because Yukinoshita and I are completely different people and I never know even the littlest bit about what sheÅfs thinking. I find it difficult to understand what she says to me. No matter how hard we try, in the end we wouldnÅft understand each other. Although the one thing I could probably understand about Yukinoshita is her loneliness. ÅgItÅfs not like I donÅft understand what youÅfre trying to say. Being alone means you can have a great time by yourself. You could even say the belief that one shouldnÅft be alone is disgusting.Åh 67 2-3 ÅgÅc..Åh Yukinoshita just looked at me for a second before she turned her face back to the front and closed her eyes. I could tell she was thinking something even from that gesture. Åg Even though you like being alone, having somebody just pour their sympathy on you would be irritating. I totally get you.Åh I said. ÅgI wonder why youÅfre acting like weÅfre on the same level. ItÅfs extremely irritating.Åh Then as if to cover up her irritation, Yukinoshita flipped her hair back. ÅgWell, although you and I are of a different standard, I suppose we more or less share the same feelings in regards to being alone. Though itÅfs a little vexing.Åh Upon say it was vexing Yukinoshita gave a slight self-deprecating smile. Her smile seemed somehow sombre yet calm. ÅgWhat do you mean when you say weÅfre of a different standardÅc.I have my own opinion on being a loner. You could pretty much call me the king of the loners. On the other hand, it would be ridiculous to call someone like you a loner.Åh ÅgWhatÅfs thisÅc.bravely facing your circumstances even though you know itÅfs futileÅcÅh Yukinoshita appeared shocked and looked at me with an expression full of amazement. 68 2-3 ÅgDespite being liked by everyone you call yourself a loner. YouÅfre a disgrace to lonely people everywhere.Åh I said triumphantly, satisfied with her expression. However Yukinoshita immediately laughed with a scornful look on her face. ÅgWell thatÅfs a simplistic idea. It seems like youÅfre only capable of simple spinal reflexes, which donÅft involve your brain. I mean, what do you understand about being liked by people? Oh thatÅfs right, youÅfve never experienced it before. Sorry, that was my lack of consideration.Åh ÅgIf youÅfre trying to be considerate then actually continue to be considerate until the endÅc..Åh Would you call that being superficially polite? She sure is a real bitch. ÅgSo whatÅfs it like being popular?Åh I asked. Yukinoshita closed her eyes as though she was thinking about it a little bit. After clearing her throat a little, she spoke. ÅgFor someone like you, who isnÅft at all popular, this may be a little unpleasant to hear.Åh ÅgIÅfm already fed up so donÅft worry.Åh I replied. Yukinoshita took a deep breath in response. I couldnÅft feel any more unpleasant. I certainly had my fill from our little exchange earlier. It was as though IÅfd just eaten an infinite amount of ramen. 69 2-3 ÅgSince I have always been cute, boys who approached me generally did so haboring feelings for me.Åh I give up. ItÅfs like she just added an extra two servings of vegetables and a serving of MSG to my ramen. But although I tried put up a front and acted all confident, I canÅft just get up and go now. I steeled myself and waited patiently for her to continue talking. ÅgI believe it began during my final years of elementary school. Ever since thenÅc.Åh YukinoshitaÅfs expression was different from what it was just previously. It was a little melancholy. It has been a little over five years now. What the hell does it even feel like to be constantly exposed to feelings of affection from the opposite sex? Frankly, having been exposed to feelings of disgust from the opposite sex for a little over sixteen years now, I could never comprehend it. Having not even received ValentineÅfs Day chocolates from my own mother, it was a world I couldnÅft understand. It just seems like sheÅfs one of those people who are gleeful cause theyÅfre winning at life. IsnÅft she just making me listen to her fucking brag? But thatÅfs just it, isnÅft it? Although itÅfs about as different as a positive vector is from a negative vector in magnitude, it would be harsh to hit her with my honest feelings. It would be like standing naked in the midst of a raging storm. It would be as harsh as persecuting her in the middle of a classroom discussion. 70 2-4 2-4 I remember being made to stand in front of the blackboard alone as the rest of the class encircled chanting ÅeApo-lo-gize! Apo-lo-gize!Åf in a loud voice as they clapped their hands. It would be a scenario similar to that hell. ÅcThat was seriously a tough experience. It was the first and last time I have ever cried at school. But IÅfm all good now. ÅgWell being liked has gotta be somewhat better than being constantly hated. YouÅfre spoiled. Too spoiled.Åh I blurted out after that unpleasant memory just crossed my mind. Yukinoshita gave a short sigh. It seemed a lot like she was smiling but yet her expression was clearly different. ÅgItÅfs not as if I have ever wanted to be liked by people though.Åh She asserted and then added only a few more words. ÅgOtherwise, if people genuinely did like me then that would have probably been a good thing.Åh ÅgHuh?Åh I unconsciously asked her to repeat what she said after hearing her soft murmur. She turned around to face me wearing a serious expression. 71 2-4 ÅgIf you had a friend who was generally popular with girls, what would you think?Åh ÅgThatÅfs a stupid question. I donÅft have any friends so I wouldnÅft need to worry about such a thing.Åh I gave an exceedingly forceful reply. Like a man would. Even if I do say so myself, I was surprised at how I quickly cut in with a reply before she had even finish talking. It seemed Yukinoshita was also surprised. She was at a loss for words with her mouth hanging open. ÅgÅc..For a second, I actually thought you said something cool.Åh Yukinoshita gently put a hand on temple as though she had a headache, and hung her head low. ÅgThink of it as a hypothetical and give me an answer.Åh ÅgIÅfd kill him.Åh I didnÅft know if my quick reply satisfied her or not but Yukinoshita nodded her head knowingly. ÅgSee, wouldnÅft you try to eliminate that person? Just like a brute that doesnÅft have any sense. No, they would have even less sense than an animalÅc..The school I went to had many people like that. Although I believe they were pitiful people who could only ascertain the meaning of their existence by doing those things.Åh Yukinoshita suddenly chortled. Girls who are hated by girls. A category like that definitely exists. I havenÅft been going to school for ten years for nothing. 72 2-4 ItÅfs not like I was at the center of it all but itÅfs something you can understand just by looking at it from the outside. No, itÅfs because I was looking at it from the outside that I was able to understand. Yukinoshita was most certainly always at the center of it and as a result, without a doubt, she was surrounded by enemies in all directions. For somebody who lived like that, I can imagine the kinds of things she experienced. ÅgWhen I was in elementary school, I had my indoor shoes hidden from me about sixty times but fifty of those times were done by girls in my class.Åh ÅgIÅfm curious about the other ten times.Åh ÅgThree of the times were done by boys. Another two times was when the teacher bought them from me. For the remaining five times, a dog had stolen them.Åh ÅgThe percentage of times done by dogs is pretty high.Åh Something like that was beyond my imagination. ÅgBut that isnÅft whatÅfs shocking about it.Åh ÅgI was trying my best to ignore you!Åh 73 2-4 ÅgThanks to that, I had to take my indoor shoes home everyday and in the end I even had to take my recorder home too.Åh Yukinoshita said with a wearied expression. Upon seeing her expression, I involuntarily felt some sympathy towards her. IsnÅft it because of that? The fact that itÅfs similar to what I experienced. The fact that in elementary school, I felt guilty cause I was in the classroom at an hour nobody would be around just so I could swap the mouthpiece of my recorder. I was just genuinely feeling sorry for Yukinoshita. ItÅfs true. ItÅfs true. Hachiman. DonÅft. Tell. Lies. ÅgThat mustÅfve been tough for you.Åh ÅgYes, it was tough. All because IÅfm cute.Åh This time it didnÅft irritate me when I saw Yukinoshita smile in self-deprecation. ÅgBut it canÅft be helped. Nobody is perfect. They are weak, they have ugly minds and they get jealous easily and try to bring others down. Oddly enough, the more superior you are the harder it is to live in this world. IsnÅft that just wrong? ThatÅfs why IÅfm going to change this worlds and the people in it.Åh YukinoshitaÅfs eyes were dead serious and habored a coldness that could burn you like dry ice could. 74 2-4 ÅgIsnÅft too insane to be putting all your effort into some extravagant plan?Åh ÅgMaybe. But itÅfs considerably better than your plan to dry up, wither away and dieÅc.I hate the way that you consider your weakness as a positive.Åh Yukinoshita said and averted her eyes to look outside the window. Yukinoshita Yukino is a beautiful girl. An infallible truth that even I was forced to acknowledge with the deepest regret. From the outside she seemed to be irreproachable, with grades that were excellent and faultless. However, her difficult personality is a fatal wound in her character. Such flaws are not cute at all. But there is a reason for her to have sustained that fatal wound. I donÅft blindly believe everything that Hiratsuka sensei says but by being someone who has a lot, Yukinoshita has her own miseries. It certainly wouldnÅft be hard to hide that by continuing to deceive yourself and those around you. ThatÅfs what most people in this world do. Just like how people who are good at studying get good grades in an exam and say that it was because they had a lucky guess at what was going to be in the exam. Just like how plainlooking girls who are jealous of beautiful girls assert that their ugliness is determined by how fat they are. But Yukinoshita doesnÅft do that. She would never lie to herself. 75 2-4 ItÅfs not like I wonÅft at least commend that attitude of hers. Because we are the same in that way. As a result of the conversation ending, Yukinoshita looked back down at her paperback book. As I watched her, a strange feeling suddenly overcame me. She and I are certainly alike in some way. I found myself thinking that in spite of myself. The silence in that moment somehow felt nice. I felt my heart beat a little faster. It was like my heart was saying it wanted to beat faster than the ticking of the second hand and beyond. ThenÅc Then she and IÅc. ÅgHey, YukinoshitaÅcIf you want, I could be your frie-Åg ÅgIÅfm sorry. That is impossible.Åh 76 2-4 ÅgWhaaaat? But I wasnÅft even finished!Åh Yukinoshita went ahead and flat out rejected me. And on top of that she had this look on her face like she was grossed out. Yup this girl aint cute at all. Romantic comedies and stuff should just go blow up. 77 3-1 Chapter 3: Yuigahama Yui is always restless. ÅgSo let me guess, even cooking class was a traumatic experience for you?Åh For some reason I was called to the teachersÅf lounge even though I handed in the home economics report to make up for skipping cooking class. This feels a hell of a lot like d?j? vu. Why are you shoving this lecture down my throat, Hiratsuka sensei? ÅgSensei, arenÅft you a Modern Japanese teacher?Åh ÅgIÅfm the schoolÅfs guidance counsellor. Tsurumi sensei pushed the responsibility to me.Åh I looked to one corner of the room to see said Tsurumi sensei watering a decorative plant. Hiratsuka sensei gave her a quick glance before returning her eyes to me. ÅgFirst, IÅfll hear your reason for skipping cooking class. Make it brief.Åh ÅgWell itÅfs just I donÅft really understand why I have participate in cooking classes with the other students.ÅcÅh 78 3-1 ÅgThat answer doesnÅft make any sense to me. Hikigaya - was it that much of a painful experience to be put into groups? Or is it because nobody let you join their group?Åh Hiratsuka sensei looked at me as though she was sincerely worried. ÅgNo, of course not. What are you talking about sensei? This is about cooking training right? In other words, training that would be pointless unless it bears resemblance to how cooking is conducted in real life. My mom cooks by herself. In other words, cooking is something that must be done alone! Conversely speaking, conducting cooking training in groups is wrong!Åh ÅgWhat youÅfre talking about and what IÅfm talking about are completely different.Åh ÅgSensei! Are saying that my beloved mother is wrong?! Unforgivable! ItÅfd pointless to say anything more than this! IÅfm outta here!Åh I replied and turned on my heel, attempting to leave the place behind me. ÅgHey! DonÅft try and make me the bad guy by storming out when IÅfm the one whoÅfs supposed to angry!Åh Åc..Did my plan fail? Hiratsuka sensei stretched out her arm and yanked the back of my collar. And soon IÅfm being made to face her a second time while being held up like a kitten. Damn. If IÅfd said ÅeHeh ÅÙ Silly meÅôÅf and stuck my tongue out, I probably would have gotten away with it. Sensei sighed and smacked my report with the back of her hand. 79 3-1 ÅgÅfHow to Make a Delicious CurryÅf ? that part is fine. The problem is what comes after that. Åe1. Cut onion into comb shapes. Then slice thinly and season. Just like how a shallow person is easily influenced by others, thinly sliced onions easily soak up the flavorÅfÅc..Who said to mix in sarcasm? YouÅfre meant to mix in beef.Åh1 ÅgSensei please stop making a face like that was a really great punÅc.IÅfm feeling embarrassed being the one looking at you.Åh ÅgEven I donÅft want to read this. You probably already know what IÅfm going to say but youÅfll have to resubmit it.Åh Sensei looked completely appalled as she put a cigarette between her lips. ÅgCan you cook?Åh She then inquired with a somewhat surprised expression as she casually flipped my report over. Well thatÅfs irritating. High school students these days can at least make curry. ÅgYes. Considering my future plans, of course I can cook.Åh ÅgAre you at the age where you want to start living on your own?Åh ÅgNo, thatÅfs not the reason.Åh 1 The word for sarcasm is îÁì˜ (hiniku) and also contains the kanji for meat which is ì˜ (niku). 80 3-1 ÅgHmm?Åh Sensei simply inquired with a look that said Åeso why?Åf ÅgBecause cooking is a skill that all house-husbands require.Åh Upon hearing my reply, she blinked her large eyes, which were modestly lined with mascara, two or three times. ÅgDo you want to become a full-time house-husband?Åh ÅgWell itÅfs an optionÅcÅh ÅgDonÅft talk about dreams with those sordid, corrupt eyes of yours. They should at least be sparkling with excitementÅc..Just for reference, how are your future plans coming along?Åh It probably wouldnÅft be a good idea to just tell her to freaking worry about her own future first so I resigned to giving her a reasonable answer. ÅgWell, I plan on going to whatever college I can get into.Åh ÅgI see.Åh Hiratsuka sensei nodded in agreement and sounded her approval. ÅgAnd after that, what kind of employment do you intend to find?Åh 81 3-1 ÅgIÅfm going to find a beautiful and distinguished woman to marry so that sheÅfll continue to support me till I die.Åh ÅgI asked about employment! Give me a specific job!Åh ÅgI already told you - House-husband.Åh ÅgThatÅfs what you call a gigolo! A dreadful way to live. They hint at the possibility of marriage and then before you know it theyÅfre in your house and theyÅfve even got a duplicate house key made and not to mention that theyÅfve started to carry their bags in and then when itÅfs time to break up they even take my furniture with them like some damn hobo!Åh Hiratsuka sensei gushed, making to sure to divulge every last detail. She was talking so vehemently that she was drawing short breaths with tears welling up in her eyes. It was too pitiful.ÅcSo pitiful that I actually wanted to cheer her up. ÅgSensei, itÅfs okay! I wonÅft be like that. IÅfll do the housework properly and become a gigolo that surpasses all other gigolos!Åh ÅgWhat kind of crazy superstring theory is that?!Åh With my future aspirations trampled on, I was forced to come to a crossroads. My dream was on the verge of being shattered so I attempted to turn the argument in my favor. 82 3-1 ÅgIt might sound bad if you call me a ÅegigoloÅf but a full-time house-husband isnÅft that bad of a choice.Åh ÅgHmm?Åh Hiratsuka sensei gave me an intense stare and leaned back in her chair with a creak. A position that said ÅeIÅfll listen, so give me what you got.Åf ÅgThanks to what you may call a gender equal society, it is only natural that women have already made social progress. Sensei being able to work as a teacher is proof of that.Åh ÅgÅcWell, I suppose youÅfre right.Åh I think IÅfve got her reeled in. Now IÅfve just got to continue talking. ÅgHowever, it only takes simple math to know that for the large amount of women who have entered the workforce, the same amount of men are out of jobs. I mean, isnÅft the number of jobs always limited no matter what?Åh ÅgWellÅcÅh ÅgTake for example a certain company fifty years ago in which a hundred percent of the labor force was comprised of a hundred males. If fifty female employees are required to work there, it follows that fifty of the existing male employees must find employment elsewhere. But thatÅfs an extremely simple calculation. 83 3-1 If you consider the current economic slump, itÅfs only a matter of time before the employment of those male laborers falls into a state of decline.Åh As I laid out my argument, Hiratsuka was stroking her chin thoughtfully. ÅgKeep going.Åh ÅgCompanies in themselves are becoming increasingly less dependent on human labor. This is a result of the widespread use of computers and the rise of the Internet allowing optimal efficiency, which has in turn improved the rate of efficiency per capita tremendously. Or if you ask for the general opinion of the public they might even say ÅeItÅfs nice that youÅfre working so hard but itÅfs a little unsettlingÅc.Åf And then there are things like work sharing too. Well something along those lines.Åh ÅgYes, that is an existing opinion.Åh ÅgAnd because house hold appliances have had remarkable developments and become more diverse, no matter who uses them, the result is still the same. Even males can do household chores properly.Åh ÅgNo, wait a second.Åh Sensei interrupted my impassioned speech. She cleared her throat a little and immediately stared at me. ÅgItÅfs kind of hard to know what to use where and where to put whatÅc..so itÅfs not like it always turns out the way you want it toÅcÅh 84 3-1 ÅgWell thatÅfs probably only for you.Åh ÅgÅc.What?Åh Her chair suddenly swivelled around as her foot delivered a kick to my shin. It hurt like hell. Then a burning glare was directed my way. I continued talking in an attempt to gloss over my words. ÅgT-the point is! Considering weÅfve worked so hard to build a society where one can get by without working, harping on about working and complaining that there arenÅft enough jobs is just plain absurd and wrong!Åh A perfect conclusion. Work and you lose to the system. Work and you lose to the system. ÅgÅc.Right. You really as rotten as ever.Åh Sensei sighed loudly. Then immediately after, she grinned widely and laughed as though sheÅfd just thought of something. ÅgIf a girl treated you to her home cooking at least once, IÅfm sure you would change that corrupt way of thinkingÅc.Åh With that sensei stood up and started shoving me by the shoulder towards the door. ÅgWa-wait! What are you doing?! Ow! I said that hurts!Åh ÅgCome back when youÅfve learnt the dignity of labor at the service club.Åh Then with a viselike grip on my shoulder, she harnessed all her strength and gave me a final shove outside the door. 85 3-1 And just as I was about to turn around and complain, the door was ruthlessly slammed shut. I suppose that means Åeno objections, rebuttals, questions or backtalkÅf. Then as soon as I thought I might as well just ditch school, I felt a throbbing pain in my shoulder from the time sensei had clamped it just beforeÅcÅcIf I run away, IÅfll probably get beaten up. The person who wired that conditioned reflex into me in such a short period of time is a terrible human being. Without any other choice, I decided to show up at the so-called service club of which one club activity seems to be solving riddles. Though it claims to be a club, I have no idea what club activities actually involve. Not to mention that the club president is even more of a mystery. WhatÅfs the hellÅfs up with her. 86 3-2 3-2 As per usual, Yukinoshita was reading a book. After exchanging only a light greeting, I moved a short distance away, pulled up a chair, and sat down. Then I took some books out of my bag. Right now, the service club had completely turned into a reading club for boys.1 But seriously - what kind of stuff does this club do? And what the hell happened to that battle weÅfre meant to have? The answer to that suddenly became apparent with the sound of a visitor timidly knocking at the door. Yukinoshita stopped turning a page of her book and decidedly inserted a bookmark inside. ÅgCome in.Åh She called, facing the door. ÅgE-excuse me,Åh came a voice that was a little excited and may have indicated some nervousness. The door was then slid open only a little so that a small gap was apparent. The girl slipped her body in through the gap and entered the room. An action that could only mean she really didnÅft want anyone seeing her come in. 1 I think this is a reference to a series of short novels called Åeê¬îNÇÃÇΩÇﬂÇÃì«èëÉNÉâÉuÅf (Seinen no Tame no Dokusho Club). It is known as ÅeThe Reading Club for the YouthÅf in English. 87 3-2 Her shoulder length brown hair was curled in loose waves that swayed as she walked. Her eyes moved around the room anxiously until they met mine. She let out a small shriek. Åc.What am I? A monster? ÅgW-why is Hikki here?!Åh ÅgÅc..IÅfm actually a member of this club.Åh Or should I say are you calling me ÅeHikkiÅf? More importantly, who the hell is this chick anyway? Frankly, I have no idea. But despite that, she looked exactly like your typical high school girl. IÅfve seen her type around a lot ? a flamboyant girl revelling in her youth. Short skirt, three buttons of her blouse popped, hair dyed light brown, and a quick glance at her chest revealed a heart charm on a gleaming necklace. It was an outfit that completely defied the school code. IÅfve no business with such girls. In fact, I have no business with any girls. However, it appeared that the opposite party knew who I was and it didnÅft seem like it would go down well if IÅfd said ÅgExcuse me but, who may you be?Åh 88 3-2 Also, I noticed that the color of the ribbon pinned to her chest was red. In our school, each grade is distinguishable by a particularly coloured ribbon. A red ribbon meant she was in grade 11 like me. Åc.ItÅfs not like I noticed because I was staring at her chest to begin with ? it just happened to enter my line of sightÅc..By the way, they were pretty bigÅc ÅgWell just sit down for the time being.Åh I said and casually pulled up a chair, motioning for her to sit. My random act of chivalry was not a pretence for masking my guilty conscience. I wanted to impress my genuinely kind disposition upon her of course. Because you know I am a real gentleman. The fact that I wear really sophisticated clothing is proof enough. ÅgTh-thank youÅc.Åh She appeared bewildered as she accepted my offer and sat down quietly. Yukinoshita, who was sitting in front of her, made eye contact. ÅgYuigahama Yuisan right?Åh ÅgY-you know who I am?Åh Her face, Yuigahama YuiÅfs, suddenly lit up when her name was called. It was like being known by Yukinoshita gave you some kind of status. 89 3-2 ÅgYou certainly know a lotÅcDo you remember everybodyÅfs name in this school?Åh I asked. ÅgNot at all. I didnÅft know you existed.Åh ÅgIs that soÅc.Åh ÅgItÅfs not really something to get depressed over. In fact, it was my mistake. I didnÅft notice your diminutive presence and above all I unintentionally wished to avert my eyes from your existence. The blame lies with the weakness of my mind.Åh ÅgIs that supposed some form of consolation? ThatÅfs a really lousy way to console someone. In the end, you pretty much concluded that itÅfs my fault.Åh ÅgI wasnÅft trying to console you. I was just being sarcastic.Åh Yukinoshita said, disregarding me as she flipped her hair over her shoulder. ÅgThis sortaÅc.seems like a really fun club.Åh Yuigahama said as she looked at Yukinoshita and me with twinkling eyes. Åc.This girl ? Is her mind just full of sunshine and daisies? 90 3-2 ÅgThat remark isnÅft particularly pleasing in any wayÅcon the other hand, your misunderstanding is terribly displeasing.Åh Yukinoshita shot her a cold glare. As Yuigahama registered her words, she became flustered and frantically waved her hands in denial. ÅgUh, no, how do I put it? I was just thinking that you guys seem to be acting really natural! Like I mean, Hikki is like totally different from how heÅfs like in class. HeÅfs like actually talking and stuff.Åh ÅgNo I can talkÅcsaying that is a littleÅcÅh Do I really look like I lack any communication skills? ÅgOh thatÅfs right. Yuigahama-san is also in class F.Åh ÅgWhat? Really?Åg I asked. ÅgDonÅft tell me you really didnÅft know that?Åh Yukinoshita asked in return. Yuigahama appeared startled by YukinoshitaÅfs words. Oh hell. 91 3-2 I know the misery of a classmate not remembering who you are more than anyone. Therefore before making her experience that same misery, I attempted to cover up my mistake. ÅgO-of course I know.Åh ÅgÅc.Why are you averting your eyes?Åh Yukinoshita asked. Yuigahama looked at me with scornful eyes. ÅgWell isnÅft that why, Hikki, you donÅft have any friends in class? I mean you act weird and itÅfs creepy.Åh Oh thatÅfs right, I remember this girlÅfs scornful eyes. Of course, the other girls in my class have also occasionally looked at me like I was piece of shit. She must be part of that clique that hangs around the soccer club a lot. What the hell. Isn't she one of my enemies then? I just wasted my time trying to be nice. ÅgÅc..This bitch.Åh I inadvertently swore under my breath. ÅgWhat? Who are you calling a bitch?!Åh Yuigahama lashed out in response. ÅgIÅfm still a vir-Åc.. w-woah! Never mind!Åh She blushed furiously and waved her hands back and forth in an attempt to take back her words. What an airhead. 92 3-2 Yukinoshita began to say something as if to save Yuigahama from her panic. ÅgItÅfs not really something to be embarrassed about. At this age being a virg-Åh ÅgW-woah hold up! What are you saying?! ItÅfs embarrassing still being one in grade 11! Yukinoshita-san, whereÅfs your sense of femininity?!Åh ÅgÅc..A pointless thing to value.Åh Woah there, I donÅft know how but Yukinoshita just increased her coldness a hundred fold. ÅgEven if you say that, the word ÅefemininityÅf just screams ÅebitchÅf to me.Åh I added in. ÅgYou said it again! Calling someone a bitch is way out of line! Hikki, youÅfre so gross!Åh Yuigahama made a small derisive growl and looked at me with teary eyes. ÅgMe calling you a bitch has nothing to do with being gross. And donÅft call me ÅeHikkiÅf.Åh IsnÅft that exactly like calling me a hikikomori?2Åc...Oh, she mustÅfve meant it as an insult in that way. That must be some kind of derogatory nickname people in my class have for me. Åc..IsnÅft that too mean? I was about to start tearing up at that. 2 A hikikomori is someone who is socially withdrawn. 93 3-2 Gossiping isnÅft any good. ThatÅfs why I say things upfront and loud and clear. Because if they donÅft hear me it from me directly, I canÅft inflict any damage! ÅgYou bitch.Åh ÅgY-you! YouÅfre so annoying! Like seriously gross! CanÅft you just go fucking die?!Åh Upon hearing those words, even I being so mild IÅfd get as irritated as a safety razor could make you, was forced into silence. There are a lot of words in this world that shouldnÅft be said. In particular, this is greatly reinforced by words concerning other peoplesÅf lives. If you arenÅft prepared to take responsibility for taking someoneÅfs life then you donÅft have the right to say those things. With the intent to reprimand her, after a moment of silence, I gave a solemn response with a markedly furious tone. ÅgYou shouldnÅft say things like Åego dieÅf or ÅeIÅfll kill youÅf so lightly or IÅfll make you bite the dust.Åh ÅgÅc.UhÅc, s-sorry. I didnÅft mean toÅc..wait what?! You just said it now! You totally said youÅfd kill me!Åh 94 3-2 95 3-2 She mightÅfve noticed but Yuigahama is really just an airhead. But what was surprising was that she seemed like the kind of girl who could actually apologize properly. She seemed a little different from what IÅfd envisioned judging by her appearance. I was certain she would be the same as the girls in her group and not to mention those guys in the soccer club and the people around them. I thought her head would always be filled with thoughts of sex, drugs and fooling around. Like some kind of Murakami Ryuu novel.3 Yuigahama let out a small sigh as though being hyper made her tired. ÅgÅc..Hey um I heard this from Hiratsuka sensei but this club fulfils studentsÅf desires right?Åh Yuigahama broke the short moment of silence. ÅgFor real?Åh I put in. I was sure that this was a club for reading books to no end. Yukinoshita completed ignored my question and answered YuigahamaÅfs. ÅgI believe it differs a little. Ultimately, the aim of this club only lies in lending people a hand. Whether or not that fulfils your desires depends upon you.Åh YukinoshitaÅfs blunt denial seemed somewhat cold. ÅgHow is it different?Åh Yuigahama asked with a dubious expression. That was exactly what I was wondering. 3 Murakami Ryuu is an author who wrote a novel called ÅeAlmost Transparent BlueÅf that deals with the issue of promiscuity and drug use among Japanese youth. 96 3-2 ÅgWould you give a hungry man a fish or would you teach him how to fish? That is where the difference lies. Essentially, a volunteer does not provide results but a methodology. I suppose Åe to encourage independenceÅf would be the most accurate answer.Åh Her speech seemed like something pulled straight out of a textbook on morals. An empty principle any goddamn school would preach - Åeclub activities that allow students to demonstrate their ability to act independently as well as with othersÅf. IÅfm sure my general understanding of the clubÅfs activities as that would be correct. And well, sensei also said something or rather about labor so it must be a club that works for the sake of the student body. ÅgThatÅfs kinda really awesome!Åh Yuigahama exclaimed with a look that said ÅeYou opened my eyes so I totally get it now!Åf I was a little worried that she might get brainwashed by some satanic religion in the future. YukinoshitaÅfs explanation held no basis in science yet big breasted girls are often the ones whoÅc.or so goes one such existing opinion in society but I believe I could say that she is the first example of that. On the other hand, with a chest as flat as a wall, sharp intelligence and unrivalled sagacity was Yukinoshita. ÅgAlthough I cannot say for sure that I will fulfil your wishes, I will help you as much as I can.Åh 97 3-2 Upon hearing those words, Yuigahama spoke up as though sheÅfd suddenly remembered what she had come here for. ÅgHey! Um I was kind of thinking about making some cookiesÅc.Åh Yuigahama said and glanced at me. IÅfm not really a cookie you know. I get that in class people treat me like IÅfm not even there but even those words sound the same, theyÅfre different. ÅgHikigaya-kun.Åh Yukinoshita said and motioned toward the hallway with a quick jerk of her chin ? a gesture that told me to get lost. She could have said it nicely without doing that by saying ÅeYouÅfre an eyesore so could you please leave? I would appreciate it if you never came back again.Åf If you need to have some kind of girl talk then thereÅfs no helping it. There are indeed things in this world that can only be discussed between girls. I could take a hint like ÅePhysical EducationÅf, ÅeNo males allowedÅf, ÅeClassroom in use for a female only lessonÅf. That about sums it up. Åc.By those female only lessons, I wonder what kind of lessons they wereÅc.It still bugs me to this day. ÅgÅc.IÅfll just go buy some ÅeSportopÅf.Åh 98 3-2 I must say IÅfm being very considerate, having sensed the situation and acted discreetly. If I were a girl, I would have definitely fallen in love with me. As I put my hand on the door to leave, Yukinoshita called out to me. Maybe even Yukinoshita had some feelings to express. ÅgIÅfll have a ÅeYasai seikatsu 100 Strawberry MixÅf.Åh To think that she can just naturally command people to do errands for her. Yukinoshita-san, youÅfre freaking unbelievable. 99 3-3 3-3 It wouldnÅft take more than ten minutes to get from the third floor to the first floor of the special building and back again. If I took my time and walked at a leisurely pace, their conversation would probably be finished by the time I got there. Well, I no matter kind of person she was, Yuigahama was our first client. In other words, her appearance marked the beginning of the so-called battle between Yukinoshita and me. Well, itÅfs not like IÅfm going to win so if I just concerned myself with figuring out how to minimise as much damage as possible, all would be good. In front of the school canteen there was a suspicious vending machine. It sold some peculiar kinds of soda in juice boxes that you canÅft find at regular convenience stores. They seem to be pretty good at replicating flavors so theyÅfve caught my interest. I was particularly interested in a soda called ÅeSportop,Åf which goes against the norm. It has a flavor like that of cheap candy and challenges the latest Åezero caloriesÅf and Åesugar-freeÅf trends. It tastes pretty good. 100 3-3 As I inserted two hundred yen coins into the vending machine, it groaned loudly like it some sky fortress about to let drop the ÅeYasai SeikatsuÅf and ÅeSportopÅf I purchased. Then, I inserted another hundred yen coin in and pressed the ÅeOtoko no Caf? au LaitÅf button. It would be weird if only two out of three people were drinking something. So IÅfd decided to buy something for Yuigahama too. The drinks were 300 yen in total meaning I had lost fifty percent of the money I had on me. I was way too broke. 101 3-4 3-4 ÅgYouÅfre late,Åh Yukinoshita said, snatching the ÅeYasai SeikatsuÅf from my hands. She poked a straw in it and started drinking. All that was left was the ÅeSportopÅf and ÅeOtoko no Caf? au Lait.Åf It seemed like Yuigahama realized who the ÅeOtoko no Caf? au LaitÅf was for. Åg... Oh right,Åh she said, pulling a hundred yen coin out of a pocket-like coin purse. ÅgAh, donÅft worry about it.Åh I mean, Yukinoshita didnÅft pay me back, and above all, I bought them of my own volition. Even though it might have been reasonable to accept money from Yukinoshita, I was not obliged to accept money from Yuigahama. So instead of taking the hundred yen coin she held out, I placed the Caf? au Lait in her hand. ÅgB-But I havenÅft paid you back!Åh Yuigahama adamantly attempted to hand me the coin. It would have been annoying to argue back and forth about her paying me back so I just walked over to my seat closer to Yukinoshita. Yuigahama appeared slightly miffed as she reluctantly put away her change. 102 3-4 Åg... Thanks.Åh She expressed her gratitude in a small voice, laughing a little happily as she shyly held the Caf? au Lait in both hands. That was most certainly the most gratitude IÅfve ever received in my entire life. She had probably overpaid me with that smiling face for what was worth only a hundred yen. ÅgHave you finished your chat?Åh Satisfied, I attempted to get Yukinoshita to show me some appreciation as well. ÅgYes. As a result of your absence, our conversation went along swimmingly. Thanks.Åh That was most certainly the least gratitude IÅfve ever received in my entire life. ÅgÅcWell, thatÅfs good. So, what are you going to do now?Åh ÅgWeÅfre going to the home economics room. YouÅfre coming with us.Åh ÅgThe home economics room?Åh It was an iron maiden-like classroom for the torture of cooking training conducted in groups of your own choosing. 103 3-4 They have kitchen knives and gas ranges, which are dangerous and should have restricted use! ÅgAnd what are we going to do there?Åh Along with gym class and field trips, cooking training was one of the top three school activities known for trauma infliction. There probably wasnÅft a single person who actually enjoyed any one of them. I mean, imagine a group that is happily chatting among themselves and getting along wellÅcthen imagine the immediate silence that fell over them the moment I had joinedÅcyeah, it was beyond unbearable. ÅgCookiesÅc I want to bake some cookies.Åh ÅgHuh? Cookies?Åh It was the only response I could give her, having had no idea what she was talking about. ÅgIt appears that Yuigahama-san wants to make homemade cookies for someone. However, she has no confidence in her ability and would like some help. That is her request,Åh Yukinoshita explained, clearing my doubt. ÅgWhy do we have to do that?Åc Get your friends to help you with something like that.Åh 104 3-4 ÅgUmÅc W-well, itÅfs just thatÅc I donÅft really want them to know and if they knew about it, theyÅfd make fun of meÅc Something serious like this wouldnÅft sit well with themÅcÅh YuigahamaÅfs eyes darted about as she answered. I let a small sigh slip. Frankly, peoples' love problems aren't easy to deal with. Rather than knowing who likes who, memorizing even one English word would be much more useful to me. Considering that, helping her with her love problems is out of the question. And well, I donÅft have any interest in such love stories beyond being made to think about them. Now that I think about itÅc That serious talk they hadÅc It must have been about thisÅc Boy, am I relieved. Honestly, to somebody with love problems, all you need to say is, ÅeDonÅft give up! ItÅfll definitely go well!Åf And if it doesnÅft go well, then all you need to say is, ÅeThat guy is seriously, like, the biggest jerk ever!Åf ÅgHah,Åh I inadvertently snorted as my eyes met YuigahamaÅfs. ÅgAh...Åh Yuihagama looked downward, at a loss for words. She then gripped the hem of her skirt, her shoulders trembling slightly. ÅgAhÅcAhaha. 105 3-4 It-itÅfs weird, isnÅft it? Someone like me trying to make homemade cookiesÅclike IÅfm trying to be some kind of girly girlÅc Sorry, Yukinoshita-san, itÅfs okay, donÅft worry about it.Åh ÅgWell, if thatÅfs what you really want, I donÅft particularly mindÅc ?Oh, I see. If youÅfre worried about him, you donÅft have to be. He doesnÅft exactly have a moral compass so IÅfll force him to help out.Åh Somehow it seemed like the Japanese constitution didnÅft apply to me. I mean, what kind of sweatshop-type exploitation was this? ÅgNo, itÅfs really okay! I mean making cookies really doesnÅft suit me and it would be weirdÅc I asked Yumiko and Mari and they said itÅfs totally old-fashioned.Åh Yuigahama stole a glance at me. Åg...Yes. I certainly wouldnÅft expect that a girl who looks as flamboyant as you do would make cookies,Åh Yukinoshita said, as if to push the already crestfallen Yuigahama further into depression. ÅgE-exactly! ItÅfs weird, isnÅft it?!Åh Yuigahama laughed anxiously as if she was waiting for us to react. Her downcast eyes suddenly looked to me, as though she was challenging me. With those eyes looking at me, I felt like she was asking me for some kind of reply. Åg...Well, what I want to say is not...that itÅfs weird, or that it doesnÅft suit you, or that itÅfs not in your personality. I really just couldnÅft care less.Åh 106 3-4 ÅgThatÅfs an even more horrible thing to say!Åh Yuigahama struck the table hard in exasperation. ÅgHikki, I really canÅft believe you! IÅfm seriously pissed off. I would do it if I put my mind to it!Åh1 ÅgThatÅfs not something you can say about yourself. ThatÅfs something your mom says, while getting emotional ? tears in her eyes and all. ÅeI always thought you would do it if you could...but of course you just can't'Åh ÅgWell, it looks like your mom already gave up on you!Åh ÅgA reasonably good conclusion.Åh Yukinoshita nodded her head eagerly. Meanwhile, Yuigahama had tears welling up in her eyes. Oh, leave me alone. Although of course, being given up on is also sad, I guess. I felt bad for being a killjoy when Yuigahama was clearly determined to make those cookies. Not to mention there was still that battle between Yukinoshita and me. ÅgWell, the only thing I can make is curry, but IÅfll still help you.Åh I reluctantly offered my assistance. 1 The original phrase used here is 'yareba dekiru ko', which can refer to someone who can do it if they try. However, thanks to the ambiguity of Japanese phrases, it can also be used in a negative sense to mean somebody who can't do anything at all, even if they try. Yuigahama uses it in the first sense and Hikigaya uses it in the second sense. 107 3-4 Åg...Th-thanks.Åh Yuigahama gave a sigh of relief. ÅgWe arenÅft really expecting anything with regards to your cooking ability. We just want you to taste the cookies and tell us your opinion.Åh Well, if it was as Yukinoshita said and a maleÅfs perspective was required, there was obviously something I could do. There is an innumerable amount of males who dislike sweet foods so my help will be required when trying to match a maleÅfs sense of taste. Not to mention that IÅfm an honest person when it comes to saying whether or not something is delicious. ...Would that come in handy? 108 3-5 3-5 The home economics room was now enveloped in the smell of vanilla essence. Yukinoshita opened the refrigerator with confidence and took out some milk and eggs. She grabbed a scale, a bowl and some other things, then started to prepare the eggs. She was using some strange cooking utensil that I wasnÅft wellacquainted with. It seemed that this perfect superhuman1 was, somehow, also unbelievably good at cooking. She put on an apron once she had finished those quick preparations, as if to say that the real cooking was about to start. Yuigahama also wore an apron, but she wore it like a first-timer; she had tied the strings into a messy, tangled knot. ÅgYour apronÅfs tangled. Do you honestly not know how to wear one?Åh ÅgSorry. ThanksÅc Wait, what?! I can at least wear an apron, you know!ÅhÅc ÅgIn that case, please put it on properly. If you donÅft do things correctly, youÅfll end up like him--someone way past the point of no return.Åh 1 Reference to the superhumans from the manga Kinnikuman. 109 3-5 ÅgDonÅft use me as a negative example--what am I, Namahage?Åh2 ÅgWell, itÅfs the first time youÅfve actually been helpful to someone, so be a little happier about itÅc Oh, but don't worry: even if you compare yourself to Namahage, I donÅft really have anything against your scalp.Åh ÅgI wasnÅft even worrying to begin withÅcStop it. DonÅft look at my hair with that pitying smile.Åh In an attempt to evade her smile-?an expression she would normally never show--I held my hair back from my hairline. I heard Yuigahama giggle. Unsurprisingly, she was still trying to put on her apron as she watched the little exchange between Yukinoshita and me from afar. ÅgYou still havenÅft tied it? Or is it because you canÅft put it on? ÅcGood grief, just come over here. IÅfll tie it for you.Åh Yukinoshita rolled her eyes as she beckoned Yuigahama over with a quick wave of her hand. ÅgÅcI think its fine,Åh Yuigahama murmured as if she was a little hesitant, looking back and forth between Yukinoshita and me. She looked like a lost, anxious kid. ÅgHurry up.Åh YukinoshitaÅfs cold tone shattered YuigahamaÅfs hesitation. I didnÅft know if she was angry or not, but it was a little scary. 2 Namahage are men dressed up as demonic monsters to scare children who are guilty of bad behavior. IÅfm not sure what the scalp thing is about but I believe itÅfs because ÅenamahageÅf means ÅescalperÅf as in a person who removes someoneÅfs scalp. 110 3-5 ÅgS-s-s-sorry!Åh Yuigahama squeaked, walking over to Yukinoshita. What was she, a puppy? Yuknoshita moved behind her and retied her strings at once. ÅgYukinoshita-sanÅc ItÅfs kind of like youÅfre my onee-chan, huh?Åh ÅgMy little sister wouldnÅft have turned out as bad as you.Åh Yukinoshita sighed and looked displeased, but, to my surprise, I actually agreed with Yuigahama. If you put the mature Yukinoshita next to the baby-faced Yuigahama, they seemed relatively similar to sisters. In any case, it felt a hell of a lot like there was definitely something familial between them. On another note, since only middle-aged men would say that wearing nothing but an apron looked nice, I thought that wearing uniform under an apron was best. I felt my heart warm up at that thought and unconsciously smirked. ÅgH-hey, HikkiÅcÅh ÅgW-what?Åh My voice cracked. CrapÅc I probably just put on a really gross face just then. And that inadvertent, nervous reply just dramatically increased that grossness. 111 3-5 ÅgW-what do you think of girls who are good at home economics?Åh ÅgWell, I donÅft exactly dislike them. ItÅfs not as if guys always find that attractive.Åh ÅgI-I seeÅcÅh Upon hearing that, Yuigahama smiled in relief. ÅgAlright! LetÅfs do this!Åh She rolled up her sleeves, cracked the eggs and starting beating them. She added wheat flour, followed by sugar, butter and some flavorings including vanilla essence. Even I, someone not well-versed in the art of cooking, could clearly see that YuigahamaÅfs abilities were far from normal. IÅfm sure she thought that merely making cookies was something extravagant, but since it was actually something very simple, it was easy to see how far from normal her competence was. There was nothing to conceal them, and so her true abilities were on full display. First, the beaten egg still had some eggshell in there. Second, the flavouring was clumping together. Third, the butter was still hard. And as expected, she had switched the flour and the salt and was pouring vanilla essence into a bowl that was already overflowing with milk. I quickly looked to Yukinoshita to see her going pale as she put a hand on her forehead. Even I, with my lack of cooking skills, felt a shiver down my spine. To Yukinoshita, who was good at cooking, this must have been an absolute abomination. 112 3-5 As I quickly looked at Yukinoshita, I could see her go pale and put a hand on her forehead. This made even a poor chef like myself shiver. To Yukinoshita, someone who was good at cooking, this must have been an absolute abomination. ÅgNow we needÅcÅh Yuigahama trailed off, then retrieved some instant coffee. ÅgCoffee? Well, I suppose if there was something to drink the foodÅfll go down easierÅc IsnÅft that a good idea?Åh ÅgHuh? ThatÅfs not it--itÅfs a secret ingredient. Boys donÅft like sweet things, right?Åh Yuigahama turned to face me as she continued working. With her gaze directed away from her hands, a black mound had formed in the middle of the bowl before she knew it. ÅgIt sure isnÅft a secret ingredient nowÅcÅh ÅgWhat? Ack. Well, IÅfll just add some more flour to fix it.Åh With that, she made a white mound next to the black one. Then she engulfed the whole thing in a tidal wave of beaten eggs, raising some kind of hellish thing. IÅfll start from my conclusion: YuigahamaÅfs cooking skills were severely lacking. It wasnÅft about whether or not they were adequate--she never had any skills to begin with. She went beyond clumsiness; she was making something so hopelessly ordinary, but she still wasnÅft someone fit to do it. She was the only person I wouldnÅft want to be my science lab partner, someone incompetent enough to get herself killed. 113 3-5 By the time the thing was done baking, it had become some kind of completely charred hot cake. I could tell from smell alone that it was bitter. ÅgW-why?Åh Yuigahama stared in horror at the abomination in front of her. ÅgI just donÅft understandÅc How is it even possible to make mistake after mistakeÅcÅh Yukinoshita murmured. I wondered if she was speaking quietly just so that Yuigahama wouldnÅft hear. Either way, she seemed to have let it slip in her impatience. Yuigahama took the abomination and arranged it on a plate. ÅgIt might look like this, butÅc We wonÅft know until weÅfve tasted it!Åh ÅgYouÅfre right--weÅfve even got someone here to do the taste testing.Åh I guffawed at that. ÅgYukinoshita. ThatÅfs a strange blunder to makeÅcThis is what youÅfd call poison testing.Åh ÅgHow is this poison?! ÅcPoisonÅc Yeah, maybe it is poisonous after all?Åh Despite her confident retort, she appeared somehow anxious; she cocked her head to one side, as if to ask, ÅeWhat do you think?Åf There was obviously nothing to say to that. I broke away from YuigahamaÅfs puppy-like expression and instead turned to draw YukinoshitaÅfs attention. 114 3-5 ÅgHey, am I really going to eat this? This is just like the charcoal they sell at Joyful Honda.Åh ÅgYou should be fine--we havenÅft used any inedible ingredients. Well, mostly. And- -Åh Yukinoshita paused before whispering, ÅgIÅfll also be eating it, so itÅfs fine.Åh ÅgFor real? Are you, perchance, actually a nice person? Or do you like me?Åh ÅgÅcOn second thought, please eat it all and go kill yourself.Åh ÅgMy badÅc I was so in shock that I blurted something weird.Åh As expected from sweets3Åc Though, that said, it was questionable to refer to the abomination in front of us that way. ÅgI asked you to taste-test, not to deal with something like this. Furthermore, I am the one who accepted her request. IÅfll at least take responsibility.Åh Yukinoshita pulled the plate over to her side. ÅgIf we donÅft establish whatÅfs wrong with it, we wonÅft be able to deal with the situation properly. Although thatÅfs not to say that we should take risks simply for knowledge's sakeÅcÅh 3 ThereÅfs a pun here. ÅgOkashiÅh means both ÅgweirdÅh and ÅgsweetsÅh in Japanese (of course the kanji is different, but the pronunciation is the same). So he said something ÅgokashiÅh about Ågokashi.Åh Hurr hurr hurr. 115 3-5 Yukinoshita picked up some of the blackened abominations, which could even be mistaken for iron ore, and looked at me. Her eyes seemed to be a little teary. ÅgWe wonÅft die, right?Åh ÅgThatÅfs what I want to knowÅcÅh I said and looked to Yuigahama; she was watching us like she wanted to join in. ÅcPerfect. ItÅfd be good if she ate it as well. Learn the pain of others. 116 3-6 3-6 We barely managed to eat YuigahamaÅfs cookies. If it was like a manga, then as soon as we finished eating them, we would have fallen sick and thrown up. In reality, they were so disgusting that I thought IÅfd prefer to just pass out. I would have happily fallen ill if it meant I didnÅft have to eat those cookies ever again. A thought then crossed my mind: did she put some fish intestines in there or something? But I guess it was only that bad, so at least it didnÅft kill us right away. However, if you think about it in the long run, it wouldnÅft be implausible to consider that its carcinogenic effects may manifest long after it has been ingested. ÅgUrghÅc ItÅfs bitter and grossÅcÅh Yuigahama said crunching on it with tears in her eyes. Yukinoshita immediately handed her a teacup. ÅgItÅfs better if you wash it down and try to avoid chewing as much as possible. And be careful not to let your tongue touch them. They are, after all, much like a potent poison.Åh DonÅft go and say horrible things so easily, god damn it. Yukinoshita poured hot water from a furiously-boiling kettle and made some black tea. Once we finally got through our assigned amounts of cookies, we drank it to rid ourselves of the foul taste. Then everything finally felt normal, and I let out a sigh of relief. 117 3-6 Then Yukinoshita opened her mouth. Did she want to disrupt our relaxed atmosphere? "Well then, let's think about how to improve these results." "How about Yuigahama never cooks again?" "IÅfve been completely rejected?!" "Hikigaya-kun, that would be our last resort." "Last resort? So thatÅfs actually an option?!" Yuigahama quickly went from shocked to despondent. Her shoulders drooped, crestfallen, as she let out a deep sigh. "I guess cooking just isn't for me after allÅc Would you call it a talent? A talent that I just don't have." Yukinoshita let out a short sigh in response. "ÅcI see. I've thought of a solution." "Let's hear it then," I prompted her. "Simply work harder," Yukinoshita calmly answered. "You call that a solution?" As far as I was concerned, that was the worst solution ever. At this point, there was nothing she could do but try her best, because there were no other options to consider. Conversely, that only meant one thing: we were at wits' end. 118 3-6 To be blunt, it was always going to be a pointless venture. It would be so much easier if she'd just say, 'There's no hope, let's stop.' Trying so hard, pointlessly putting effort into this, was way beyond futile. If Yukinoshita did break the news to her and just say that she was doomed, then she could put all that time and labor into other things--that would be much more efficient. "Hard work is an excellent solution--if we do it the right way, that is," Yukinoshita said as if she had read my mind. Did she have extrasensory perception or something? "Yuigahama-san, you said you didn't have any talent, right?" "Huh? Oh, yeah." "Please rid yourself of that idea. Those who do not exert the least amount of effort are unqualified to envy the talented. Those who cannot succeed are unable to because they cannot imagine the painstaking accumulation of hard work by those who do." Yukinoshita's words were bitter. They were so undeniably true that there was no room for rebuttal. Yuigahama was at a loss for words; she must've never had anyone hit her with the truth like that. An expression of bewildered panic crossed her face until she covered it up with a grin. ÅgB-but, uh, people donÅft really do this sort of thing these daysÅc It definitely doesnÅft suit me, not at all.Åh 119 3-6 Just as YuigahamaÅfs shy laughter died down, there was a sound of a cup clinking as it was put down. It could only have been a very quiet, small sound, yet it rang out crystal clear, forcibly drawing our gaze in its direction. There sat Yukinoshita, radiating a cheerful aura. ÅgÅcPlease stop trying to conform to those around youÅc ItÅfs terribly unpleasant. IsnÅft it embarrassing to place the blame for your lack of ability, your clumsiness, and your foolishness on others?Åh YukinoshitaÅfs voice was strong. She was so obviously disgusted that even I was taken aback, surprised enough to let out a quiet ÅeW-whoaÅcÅf The overwhelmed Yuigahama fell into silence. She hung her head low, so I couldnÅft read her face very well, but the way her hand gripped the edge of her skirt betrayed her emotions. She was definitely an adept communicator--after all, she hung out with the popular kids, and that required both simple good looks and people skills. In other words, she was good at adjusting herself to other peopleÅc But that could also mean she simply lacked the courage to be herself if it meant she had to risk ending up all alone. On the hand, Yukinoshita was just as determined to walk down her own path. She was certainly headstrong in that respect. When you considered their preferences regarding being alone, you saw that they were each an entirely different kind of girl. If we were talking about who held more power, Yukinoshita was clearly the stronger one. It was a fair argument. 120 3-6 YuigahamaÅfs eyes were tearing up. ÅgI-iÅc.Åh I wondered if she was trying to say, ÅeIÅfm going home.Åf Her involuntary, faint speech made it sound as if she was about to cry. Her shoulders trembled, so her voice helplessly trembled too. ÅgIncredibleÅcÅh ÅgHuh?!Åh Yukinoshita and I chorused. What the heck was this girl sayingÅc? We inadvertently exchanged looks. ÅgYou really just say it straightÅc And thatÅfs just, wellÅc ItÅfs really coolÅcÅh Yuigahama was eager as she stared at Yukinoshita. YukinoshitaÅfs expression stiffened, and she fell back two steps. ÅgJ-just what are you sayingÅc Did you even hear me? IÅfm fairly certain my words were quite harsh.Åh ÅgNo way! Not at all! Well, I mean, your words were harsh and honestly, I was a little taken aback.Åh Yes, thatÅfs quite trueÅc Frankly, I didn't think Yukinoshita would say something like that to one of her fellow female peers. 121 3-6 122 3-6 Harsh didn't seem enough to describe those words, so I was considerably taken aback. Though IÅfm sure that Yuigahama was more than just 'taken aback.' ÅgBut I really think you were just being honest with me. I mean, even when you were talking to Hikki, you two were only exchanging mean things, but you talked to each other properly. IÅfve only ever tried to fit in and say what was expected of me, so this is a first for meÅcÅh Yuigahama didnÅft run away. ÅgIÅfm sorry. IÅfll do it again properly.Åh Once she had apologized, she faced Yukinoshita head on. ÅgÅcÅh To my surprise, this time it was Yukinoshita who was at a loss for words. It was probably the first time Yukinoshita had experienced something like that. There are unexpectedly few people who do the right thing and actually apologize. Most just go deep red in the face and get really angry. Yukinoshita suddenly turned her head sideways and brushed her fingers through her hair. That motion that said she was looking for something to say but couldnÅft find anything. ManÅc She seriously sucks at ad-libbing. ÅgÅcTeach her the right way to make them. Yuigahama, make sure you actually pay attention to what she says.Åh Once I broke the silence between them, Yukinoshita let out a short sigh and nodded in assent. ÅgIÅfll make one model batch, so you can try and make it exactly like I do.Åh Yukinoshita stood up and quickly began preparations. 123 3-6 She rolled up her sleeves, broke some eggs into a bowl and then began to beat them. She sifted in a precisely-weighed amount of wheat flour and mixed it together so that it wouldnÅft clump, then she added sugar, butter, and flavorings, such as vanilla essence. Her skill greatly exceeded YuigahamaÅfs. She had made the cookie dough in the blink of an eye, then she started cutting it into circles, stars and heart shapes with a cookie cutter. There was already baking paper laid out on a baking tray. She carefully placed the dough on the tray and placed it in a preheated oven. A short time later, an ineffably nice smell filled the room. It was easy to infer that if prior preparations were done perfectly, the end result would be good. And as expected, the baked cookies were a sight for sore eyes. Yukinoshita put them onto plates and handed them out. They were baked a beautiful light brown and were definitely what one would call ÅecookiesÅf. They were well-made, just like my auntÅfs cookies. They deserved gratitude. As soon as I took one and put it in my mouth, my face naturally broke into a smile. ÅgSo good! What kind of p?tissier are you?Åh I let my true impressions slip. I couldnÅft stop my hands and put another one in my mouth. It was delicious, of course. I probably wouldnÅft be able to ever experience eating a girl's handmade cookies again, so I took the opportunity to put another one in my mouth. (YuigahamaÅfs weren't exactly cookies, so they didnÅft count.) 124 3-6 ÅgTheyÅfre really goodÅc Yukinoshita-san, youÅfre amazing.Åh ÅgThank you.Åh Yukinoshita smiled without any hint of sarcasm. ÅgBut, you see, I just followed the recipe exactly. Therefore, you should be able to make them the same way. If it doesnÅft work out, then thereÅfs probably some other reason for that.Åh ÅgWell, canÅft I just use these cookies?Åh ÅgThen it wonÅft mean anything. So, Yuigahama-san, letÅfs do our best.Åh ÅgY-yesÅc Do you think I can really do it? Can I really make cookies like you?Åh ÅgOf course. If you follow the recipe, that is.Åh Yukinoshita didnÅft forget to warn her. Thus did YuigahamaÅfs second attempt begin. Just like a rehash of YukinoshitaÅfs version, Yuigahama used the same process and the same actions. Well, she really is only re-baking the cookies, soÅc That was a pretty tasteful pun.1 I was sure that the finished cookies would also be quite tastyÅc I just kept pulling those puns out of nowhere. HoweverÅc 1 The word for 'rehash' in Japanese literally means 're-bake', hence the double meaning. 125 3-6 "Yuigahama-san, that's not how you do it. When you sift the flour, try and make a more circular shapeÅc A circle, I said, a circle. Do you understand? Didn't you learn about circles in elementary school?" "When you mix the ingredients, make sure you hold the bowl down properly. The bowl is also turning, so you're not mixing the ingredients at all. Don't stir, fold through the mixture." "No, no, you're doing it wrong. You don't need to add that to enhance the flavour. We can add things like canned peaches next time. If you add something that holds a lot of water, the dough will die. It won't be redeemable." Yukinoshita--the Yukinoshita Yukino--was confused. She was totally distressed. When the dough finally, somehow, managed to get into the oven, she heaved a sigh. Her usual audacity had vanished, and a bead of sweat ran down her forehead. When the oven was opened, a nice aroma emerged, closely resembling Yukinoshita's previous batch of cookies. HoweverÅc "They're somehow differentÅc" Despondent, Yuigahama's shoulders dropped. Tasting them showed that they were clearly different from Yukinoshita's. Nonetheless, they well and truly deserved to be called 'cookies'. 126 3-6 Compared to that charcoal-like thing before, they were so much betterÅc Honestly, I didn't really mind eating them. "ÅcHow should I instruct you so that you understand?" Puzzled, Yukinoshita tilted her head in thought. When I watched her, I realized that the reason was obvious: she was just terrible at explaining things. To be frank, Yukinoshita was a genius, and therefore thereÅfs no way she could even begin to understand the feelings of normal people. She simply couldnÅft understand what caused them to fail. You could say that following a recipe exactly is like using a formula in mathematics. People who are bad at mathetmatics canÅft understand why the formula exists, and they canÅft understand how the formula can be used to arrive at an answer. Yukinoshita just canÅft understand why Yuigahama canÅft understand. If I said that to her, it would probably sound like I was trying to say that she was in the wrong. I wasnÅft. Yukinoshita tried her best; the problem was Yuigahama. ÅgWhy didnÅft they turn out right? ÅcEven after I made them just like you told me to.Åh She looked downright stupefied as she reached out for a cookie. 127 3-6 If you believe that people who are truly smart should be good at teaching others, no matter how stupid the student, then youÅfre wrong. No matter what you say to an idiot, theyÅfre just plain stupid, so they wonÅft understand. You can explain it to them countless times, but that ditch in their minds just wonÅft fill up. ÅgMhmmÅc They really are different than yours, Yukinoshita-san.Åh Yuigahama was disheartened and Yukinoshita had buried her head in her hands. As I watched their predicament, I munched on another cookie. ÅgHey, uh, IÅfve been thinking: why are you guys trying to make delicious cookies?Åh ÅgWhat?Åh Yuigahama looked at me, and her expression said, ÅeWhat the hell are you saying, you virgin?Åf It was a pretty condescending face, so I got a little annoyed. ÅgAre you such a slut that you donÅft understand anything? Are you stupid?Åh ÅgI told you to stop calling me a slut!Åh ÅgYou really donÅft understand the first thing about how guys think.Åh ÅgThereÅfs no way I could! IÅfve never even gone out with anyone before! Well, I mean, a lot of my friends have boyfriendsÅc So I was just following what they do, and this is how it turned outÅcÅh YuigahamaÅfs voice grew quieter and quieter as I listened, to the point where I couldnÅft hear her at all. 128 3-6 Speak clearly, okay? Clearly. Are you trying to emulate me how I act when the teacher picks on me in class? ÅgThe state of YuigahamaÅfs lower half isnÅft the problem here. What are you trying to say in the end, Hikigaya-kun?Åh Well, whatÅfs with Åelower halfÅcÅf These days, I donÅft even see that expression on the posters inside trains. Just how old are you? I paused for dramatic effect then laughed boastfully, as if I had the upper hand. "HahÅc It seems as though the two of you have not had the pleasure of eating real home-made cookies. Come here after ten minutes, and then I'll let you taste 'real' home-made cookies.Åh "What did you sayÅc? What a wonderful proposition. I'm looking forward to it, you know!" Maybe she found it offensive that I had rejected her cookies, but Yuigahama said that, dragged Yukinoshita with her and disappeared into the hallway. Well, thenÅc It was my turn to make a move in this battle. In other words, it was the point that would decide the final and ultimate solution to this problem. 129 3-7 3-7 The home economics room was soon enveloped by an ominous atmosphere. "Are these the 'real' homemade cookies? They're unevenly shaped and burnt here and there. They'reÅc" Yukinoshita stared dubiously at the things in front of her. Then Yuigahama suddenly moved her head, peering at them from the side. "Hah, you talk big, but there's nothing special about these. Hilarious! They aren't even fit to eat!" She suddenly gave a derisive laughÅc Or, rather, a roar of laughter. Damn youÅc You'd better remember saying that. "Well, before you say that, please, try them." I kept a relaxed smile as I tried to keep the corners of my mouth from twitching. With that smile, I pretended to believe that my preparations were flawless--that I hadn't expected criticism, that I was absolutely certain of my victory. "Well, if you're going to go that farÅc" Yuigahama timidly put a cookie in her mouth. Yukinoshita also took one without saying anything. There was a pleasant crunching noise, then immediate silence. It was doubtlessly the calm before the storm. "Th-this is!" Yuigahama's eyes widened as she searched for the right words to express the taste. 130 3-7 "They're not really anything specialÅc I mean, some parts are pretty hard to chew! They're not really that delicious, seriously!" Her emotions turned a full 360 as she went from surprised to furious. It might have been because of her huge mood swing, butÅc Yuigahama sent a glare my way. The silent Yukinoshita looked at me suspiciously. It seemed as though she had somehow figured it outÅc I noted both of their expressions, and then I gently lowered my eyes. "I see. So they aren't deliciousÅc Even after I tried my best." "--AhÅc Sorry." Yuigahama awkwardly lowered her eyes to the floor when she saw my downcast gaze. "I guess I'll throw them out." I snatched the plate, then turned to walk away. "P-please, wait." "Åcwhat is it now?" Yuigahama had grabbed my hand to stop me. She didn't let go or answer me; instead, she grabbed one of the uneven cookies and put it in her mouth. Then she bit down on it, grinding her teeth together. 131 3-7 "They're not really bad enough to throw awayÅc And they're not as gross as I said they were." "ÅcI see. Then, are you satisfied with them?" I cracked a smile, and Yuigahama silently nodded before quickly looking away. The light of the sunset streamed through the window, making her face seem red. "Well, to be honest, those are the cookies you made earlierÅc" I told her the truth nonchalantly, without flinching. I hadn't ever said that I'd made them, so I hadn't lied. "Åchuh?" Yuigahama raised her voice. Her eyes widened and her mouth hung openÅc In other words, she was an airhead. "W-what?" Yuigahama blinked her eyes. Yukinoshita and I exchanged glances; it seemed that Yuigahama didn't get it, not at all. ÅgHikigaya-kun, IÅfm not sure I understand what you were trying to doÅc Was there any meaning in that farce of yours?Åh The displeased Yukinoshita stared at me. ÅgThere is a saying that goes, ÅeIf there is love, love is okay!!ÅfÅh I flashed a brilliant smile and gave a firm thumbs up.1 1 ÅeApron of LoveÅf is a cooking show loosely based on ÅeIron ChefÅf. Over the course of the series, female celebrities compete against each other to be the Top Apron. They are known as the ÅeApron GirlsÅf and their dishes are judged by male celebrities and the hosts, with the results appearing on the Ranking Board. The showÅfs catchphrase is ÅgCooking is love, and if done with love, Love is O.K.!Åf 132 3-7 ÅgThat show is so oldÅcÅh Yuigahama responded in a small voice. Well, it was a show that aired when I was in elementary schoolÅc Yukinoshita, meanwhile, stood there with her head tilted in open confusion. It seemed that she didn't understand. ÅgYou guys are trying to jump too many hurdles.Åh I unconsciously broke into a smile. Man, what was that sudden sense of superiority? It was as if I was the only who knew the right answerÅc I couldnÅft stand it. ÅgJeezÅc The point of hurdles isn't to jump over them, itÅfs to finish the race as quick as possible. ThereÅfs no rule that says you have to jump over them. You sh-Åh I unintentionally started babbling. ÅgI understand what youÅfre trying to say, so just stop talking.Åh Åe--ouldnÅft worry about pushing, barreling or blowing down those hurdles.Åf That's what I meant to say. ÅgYouÅfre trying to say that our efforts so far have confused our means and our ends, correct?Åh ÅcI didnÅft really get what she meant, but I was sure that she was trying to say the exact same thing as me, so I just nodded and continued. ÅgThe point is the painstaking effort of making those handmade cookies. If you donÅft stress that you made them, then thereÅfs no pointÅc 133 3-7 It wonÅft make someone happy if theyÅfre exactly the same as storebought. You could even say that itÅfs better if they taste a little worse.Åh ÅgA little worse?Åh Yukinoshita's face showed her complete lack of understanding. ÅgIf you make the recipient think, ÅeAh, I see. These arenÅft exactly well-made, but they tried their best!Åh then theyÅfll mistakenly think, ÅeYou tried really hard for my sakeÅcÅf Even though that's kind of pitiful.Åh ÅgIÅfm sure itÅfs not that simpleÅcÅh Yuigahama looked at me suspiciously; her look basically said, ÅeWhat the hell is this virgin going on about?Åf Guess thereÅfs no helping itÅc Perhaps my next step should be something a little more persuasive. ÅgÅcThis is the story of a friend of a friend, butÅc When he had just begun 10th grade, it was the start of the semester, so it was the time to decide who would be the class representative. As you might expect, all the boys were in their teenage angst stage2 , so they were all reluctant to be chosen. So, naturally, they ended up having to choose someone at random. By some natural turn of events, my friend of a friend was chosen, and the teacher handed the reins over to him. 2 The original word used here is ÅechuunibyouÅf, which literally translates to Åesecond year of junior high school sickness.Åf 134 3-7 First, he had the task of choosing a female representative. It was a lot of responsibility for a shy, reserved and timid boy.Åh ÅgAll those words have the same meaningÅc And your introduction is too long.Åh ÅgJust shut up and listenÅc At that time, one girl opted to run for the position. She was a cute girl. And like that, the new male and female class presidents were inaugurated. The female representative wore a bright smile as she said, ÅeI look forward to working with you for the coming year.Åf Then she began to talk to my friend of a friend about various things, so he started to think, ÅeHuh? Does she maybe like me? Maybe she opted to run for president once IÅfd be chosen. SheÅfs talking to me a lot, so that definitely has to mean she likes me!Åf It didnÅft take very long for him to convince himself, probably about a week.Åh ÅgWhoa! ThatÅfs quick.Åh Yuigahama raised her voice in surprise as she nodded her head. ÅgDonÅft be stupid; you canÅft put a timeline on love. So, anyway, one day after school, when they were collecting a printout that the teacher requested, he mustered the courage to confess. ÅeH-hey, do you have anyone you like?Åf ÅeH-huh? No way!Åf 135 3-7 ÅeThat answer definitely means you do! Who is it?Åf ÅeÅcwho do you think it is?Åf ÅeI told you I have no idea. A hint! Give me a hint!Åf ÅeWell, I donÅft really want toÅcÅf ÅeWell then just give me one of his initials. It doesnÅft matter if itÅfs his last or first name, so please!Åf ÅeWellÅc I suppose thatÅfs okay.Åf ÅeReally?! Score! So, what is it?Åf ÅeÅcH.Åf ÅeHuhÅc Does that meanÅc me?Åh ÅeHuh? What are you saying? ThereÅfs no way I would! ThatÅfs so gross. Could you just stop it?Åf 136 3-7 ÅeAhÅc HahaÅc Right, yeah. That was just a joke.Åf ÅeUmÅc It doesnÅft seem like it wasÅc Well, we're done, so IÅfm going home.Åf ÅeY-yeah, okay.Åf "So then, once I was left all alone in the classroom, I watched the sunset as tears fell down my faceÅc And to top it off, when I went to school the next day, everyone knew about it.Åh ÅgSo it was about you after allÅcÅh Yuigahama murmured, feeling awkward as she averted her gaze. ÅgWait, what? DonÅft be stupid. Nobody said it was about me. That was just a, you know, a figure of speech.Åh Yukinoshita didn't even consider my explanation, simply sighing in annoyance. ÅgAs soon as you said it was the story of a Åefriend of a friendÅf, I knew. I mean, you donÅft even have any friends.Åh ÅgWhat did you say?!Åh ÅgPutting aside your traumatic experience, what was the point of all that?Åh 137 3-7 There was no way that it would end wellÅc That incident made girls start to hate me even more. The boys made fun of me by giving the nickname ÅeNarugayaÅf and Well, I guess it doesnÅft matter.3 I tried to get a grip on my feelings, then I continued talking. ÅgWell, what IÅfm trying to say is, males are helplessly simple. They get the wrong idea if you just talk to them and theyÅfre happy just to get homemade cookies. SoÅcÅh I paused to look at Yuigahama. ÅgThose cookies arenÅft really anything specialÅc TheyÅfre a little hard to bite here and there, but to be honest, itÅfs fine even if they aren't that tasty.Åh ÅgSh-shut up!Åh YuigahamaÅfs face burned red with anger. A moment later, a plastic bag and some greaseproof paper came flying my way. She may have hit me, but the fact that she chose things that wouldnÅft hurt meant that she was actually pretty nice. WaitÅc Could that possibly mean that she likes me? Or was that just a joke? As if I could go through that experience againÅc ÅgSeriously, Hikki! YouÅfre pissing me off. IÅfm leaving!Åh Yuigahama glared at me, grabbing her bag as she stood up to leave. She turned towards the door with a Åehmph!Åf and began to walk towards it. Her shoulders were really trembling. Crap. Maybe I said too muchÅc When I thought about it, I realized that letting my foul mouth run wild in class again was in bad taste. So I tried to follow it up with something better. 3 The ÅenaruÅf in ÅenarugayaÅf stands for narcissistic. 138 3-7 ÅgWell, you knowÅc If you give off the impression that you tried your best, wonÅft you touch a manÅfs heart?Åh Yuigahama looked back over her shoulder as she stood before the door. I couldnÅft see her expression with the light of sunset shining behind her. ÅgÅcHikki, would you be touched?Åh ÅgHuh? Oh, yeah, I would be touched, big time! I mean, if anyone is this nice to me, I'm already ready to fall for them. And donÅft call me Hikki.Åh I responded instantly. ÅgAhÅc Okay.Åh Yuigahama gave me an indifferent response and immediately turned back toward the door. She put her hand on the door handle and was about to leave, but Yukinoshita called out to her. ÅgYuigahama-san, what should we do with your request?Åh ÅgOh, itÅfs okayÅc Don't worry about it! Next time, IÅfll try my own way. Thank you, Yukinoshita-san.Åh Yuigahama turned to face Yukinoshita with a smile. ÅgSee you tomorrow.Åh She waved and left the room with thatÅc But she was still wearing her apron. ÅgÅcI wonder if that really went okay.Åh Yukinoshita stared at the door and whispered to herself. ÅgI think that people should try to reach their own limits and surpass themÅc That would be what's best for Yuigahama-san in the long run.Åh 139 3-7 ÅgTrue, I guess. Hard work will never betray youÅc Though it may betray your dreams.Åh ÅgWhat is the difference?Åh The wind caressed Yukinoshita's face as she turned toward me. Her hair was swaying gently in the breeze. ÅgWorking hard isn't enough to ensure that your dreams always come trueÅc Un fact, it's far more common for them not to. But you can still find solace in the fact that your tried your best.Åh ÅgThatÅfs just simple self-satisfaction.Åh ÅgWell, it isn't as if youÅfre really betraying yourself.Åh ÅgHow self-indulgentÅcYou disgust me.Åh ÅgSociety, you included, is much too harsh to meÅc You should at least let me be nice to myself. In fact, I think everyone should treat themselves more gently. If everybody is hopeless, then there's no such thing as a hopeless person.Åh ÅgThis is the first time IÅfve encountered a pessimistic idealistÅc If your ideas ever catch on, then the world will fall into ruin.Åh Yukinoshita seemed surprised, but I happened to like my way of thinking. 140 3-7 Some day, NEETs will make a nation of the NEETs, by the NEETs, for the NEETs, NEEToriaÅc Though it will probably perish in just three days or so.4 4 NEET stands for Åenot in education, employment or training.Åf 141 3-8 3-8 I finally understood the purpose of the service clubÅfs activities: in short, the club gives advice to students and helps them solve their problems. However, its existence wasnÅft particularly well known. I, for one, didnÅft even know it existed, and itÅfs not as if IÅfm completely ignorant of our school. If you consider that even Yuigahama didnÅft recognise this club, then someone must act as a go-between and lead people here for advice. That someone is Hiratsuka-sensei. Sensei must sometimes send students who have problems and worries hereÅc To this isolation ward, that is. In my time in this sanatorium, I've just read books. After all, seeking counsel means revealing your insecurities. Talking about something like that is a high hurdle for emotionally sensitive high schoolers. Yuigahama came here on Hiratsuka-senseiÅfs word; otherwise, thereÅfs no way anybody would have come here. There were still no customers, but business was open as usual. Yukinoshita and I were both the sort who didnÅft mind silence, so the times we just put our all into reading, like we were now, were peaceful. ThatÅfs why that hard knock on the door echoed so loudly. 142 3-8 ÅgYahallo!Åh Yuigahama Yui slid the sliding door open with a stupid, insipid greeting. I averted my eyes from the bare legs barely covered by her short skirt, but they soon found their way to her wide-open blouse. She really was a girl with a lot of slut power. Yukinoshita laid eyes on her, then she gave a huge sigh, murmuring to herself. ÅgÅcwhat do you want?Åh ÅgHuh? Am I not really welcome hereÅc? Um, Yukinoshita-sanÅc Do you hate me?Åh YuigahamaÅfs shoulders began to tremble. Yukinoshita sighed as though she was thinking about it. Then she replied in a mundane voice. ÅgI donÅft particularly hate youÅc I just think youÅfre a little hard to deal with.Åh ÅgWhen a girl says that, it means that she hates you!Åh Naturally, she didn't want to be hated. She just looked like your typical slut on the outside, but her reaction was just what you'd expect from a normal girl. ÅgSo, do you need something?Åh ÅgWell, you know how IÅfve been really into cooking lately?Åh 143 3-8 ÅgNo, this is the first time I've heard that.Åh ÅgWell, this is just as, like, thanks for the other day, but I made some cookiesÅcÅh The blood quickly drained from YukinoshitaÅfs face. If you thought about YuigahamaÅfs cooking, then the first thing that came to mind was that deep black iron ore sort of thing that she had made before. Even I got thirsty when I thought of that. ÅgWell, I donÅft have much of an appetite right now, so IÅfm fine, thank you. Your gratitude is enough.Åh Yukinoshita had probably only lost her aptitude just nowÅc But Yukinoshita was kind enough not to say that. Yukinoshita had politely declined, but Yuigahama still hummed contentedly as took out a cellophane package from her bag. It was clearly a cutely-packaged bag of blackened cookies. ÅgWell, itÅfs actually fun when you try itÅc Maybe IÅfll try making lunch or something next! So anyway, Yukinon, letÅfs eat lunch together.Åh ÅgNo. I like eating by myself, so I donÅft really want toÅc Also, please donÅft call me ÅeYukinon.Åf It makes me sick.Åh 144 3-8 ÅgNo wayÅc ArenÅft you lonely? Yukinon, where do you eat lunch?Åh ÅgHere, butÅc Hey, are you listening to me?Åh ÅgAh, okay then, wellÅc IÅfm free after school, so IÅfll help you with club activities. Well, like, you knowÅc I'm returning the favor? Yeah, I'm returning the favor, so donÅft worry about it at all.Åh ÅgÅcare you listening to me?Åh Yukinoshita was clearly lost in YuigahamaÅfs constant waves of conversation. She kept looking to me, as if to say ÅeDo something about her.Åf As if IÅfm going to help you outÅc You always verbally abuse me, you havenÅft paid me back for that Yasai Seikatsu I bought youÅc And sheÅfs your friend. Honestly, Yukinoshita had sincerely attempted to tackle YuigahamaÅfs problem, so thatÅfs probably why Yuigahama was trying so hard to pay her back. Therefore, Yukinoshita had the right and responsibility to accept her gratitude. ItÅfd be bad to interfere, so I closed my paperback book and immediately rose from my seat. I muttered my ÅeSee you laterÅf quietly, so they wouldnÅft hear, and prepared to leave the room. ÅgAh, Hikki!Åh 145 3-8 I heard my name and turned around to see a blackened thing flying towards my face. I caught it reflexively. ÅgI kinda need to thank you too, since you helped out as well.Åh It was something deep black and heart shapedÅc How ominous. Still, she was trying to thank me, so I accepted. Oh, and donÅft call me Hikki. 146 147 148 149 4-1 Chapter 4: Nevertheless, class is going well. The ringing chime signaled the end of fourth period, sending a wave of relief through the classroom. Some people ran off to buy lunch, some noisily dug through their desks for their bento boxes, and the rest left for other classrooms. As usual, the classroom of Grade 11's Class F was consumed by a grand lunchtime din. It was raining, so I found myself without a place to go. I usually had a perfect spot to eat lunch, but I had no interest in getting rained on as I ate. And so, left with no other choice, I sat in the classroom and ate my convenience store bread in silence. I would have liked to spend this kind of rainy-day lunch break reading a novel or manga or something, but I'd left all the books I was still reading at home. Maybe I should've gone back to get them during the ten minute breakÅc But that train had already left the station. I guess the Japanese way to put that would be Ågato no matsuri.Åh In English that would be Ågafter the festivalÅhÅc No, no, that would be Ågmatsuri no atoÅh!1 1 He referenced a Japanese idiom, tried to translate it into English, and then corrected himself. ItÅfs not too important to understand the idiom ? heÅfs just screwing around a bit. 150 4-1 Yeah, I was so bored that I was playing both sides of a comedic dialogue by myself. Seriously, thoughÅc IÅfve always thought this, but when you spend a lot of time by yourself, you find that things just kind of happen. If you're alone at home, you start talking to yourself more and more. Then you start singing loudly to yourself. And then there are a lot of times when your little sister comes home and you go, ÅgMOTTO! MOTT- AhhÅc Hi there.Åh2 But I still donÅft sing in the classroom. And as a result, I often end up thinking about things. In a sense, loners are masters of thinking. It's said that man is a frail animal but also a thinking animal, and before you realize it, you'll find yourself thinking about something. And because loners donÅft have to spare any thoughts for other people, they can think about things even more deeply. And so, loners like me possess circuitry in our brains that allow us to think differently from normal people, and this sometimes gives us the ability to come up with ideas beyond the capability of normal humans. ItÅfs very difficult to try and express the colossal amount of information in the universe through speech alone. It's like a computer. It takes time to upload huge amounts of data to servers or to send it by e-mail. That's the only reason why loners tend to be unskilled at conversation.) 2 Could be a reference to the Kannagi opening theme, but IÅfm not positive. 151 4-1 But I think that this isnÅft always a bad thing. Computers donÅft exist just for the sake of email--there's the internet and things like Photoshow3 too. So donÅft think that one single point of view is enough to judge a person. Well, I pulled out computers as an example there, but itÅfs not like IÅfm that knowledgeable when it comes to computersÅc If you want people who know a lot about computers, then you want the people huddled together at the front of the class. Those people were holding PSPs and doing a hunt in Ad-Hoc wireless mode. What were their names again? OdaÅc or TaharaÅc Something like that? ÅgHey you, use a hammer or something!Åh ÅgNah, a gunlance is already way more than I need ^^.Åh They did look like they were having funÅc I do play the game they were playing, so if I'm being honest, some part of me wanted to go and join in. A long time ago, things like manga, anime, and games were fields dominated by the loners. Lately, though, they had become another way to communicate, and joining in with people like that now required a certain level of communication ability. 3 An obvious reference to Photoshop. 152 4-1 And unfortunately, I seem like a person who half-asses everything, so if I tried to join them they would call me a n00b or a fake when I wasnÅft listening. So what the hell should I have done? When I was in middle school, I saw some people talking about anime so I tried to join in, but it was clear that they clammed up when they saw me. It was really hard on meÅc That was when I stopped trying to join that crowd. And IÅfve never been the kind of guy who tries to get people to include me, so it was even worse. When we played football or baseball as a class, the two most popular boys would do rock paper scissors to decide who would get the first pick. And I was always the last picked, you know? When I look back at my ten-year-old self, when I remember how pitifully nervous I was when they were picking teamsÅc That almost brings me to tears, seriously. I wasnÅft physically unfit, but that's why I started to become bad at sports. I liked baseball, but I couldnÅft find anyone to play it with meÅc So when I was young, I would always just play off a wall or do fielding practice by myself. I was completely used to playing baseball by myself; I'd pretend there were imaginary people in the field or at bat. But there were also people in this class who were good at that kind of communication. The people in the back of the class right now, for example. 153 4-1 There were two people from the soccer team, three boys from the basketball team, and three girls. Just one look at the lively atmosphere surrounding that group was enough to tell you that they were at the top of the classÅfs social ladder. (By the way, Yuigahama was also part of that group. And even within that group, there were two people shining brighter than all the others: Hayama Hayato. That was the name of the person at the center of that group. He was the soccer teamÅfs ace player, and was a candidate for team captain next semester. He was not a person I enjoyed staring at for extended periods of time. In other words, he was a good-looking, faux-stylish guy. Go to hell. ÅgNah, I canÅft do it today. I have practice.Åh ÅgCanÅft you just spare a day? Double scoops at Baskin Robbins are on sale today~~. I want a chocolate-cocoa double scoop.Åh ÅgArenÅft those both just chocolate? (lol)Åh ÅgEhhh? No, theyÅfre completely different! Plus, IÅfm really hungry right now.Åh 154 4-1 And the one raising her voice was HayamaÅfs partner, Miura Yumiko. Her blonde hair was styled into ringlets, and if you saw how she wore her school uniform in a completely sloppy way down to her shoulders, you'd think she was proud of it. Was she supposed to be a prostitute or something? And her skirt was so short that there was hardly a point in her wearing it. She had nice features and a pretty face, but her stupid behavior and gaudy clothing meant that I didnÅft like her very much. Or, rather, I was really just afraid of her. You just never knew what she was going to say to you. But (at least from what IÅfve seen) Hayama wasnÅft afraid of Miura, and in fact thought of her as someone fun to talk to. That's why I really didnÅft understand how the kings and queens of the social ladder thought. No matter how you looked at it, that girl was obviously only a "fun person" when she was talking with Hayama. If I talked to her, then she would kill me with a single glance. Well, that said, we didnÅft really ever have a reason to talk with each other, so it was fine. Meanwhile, Hayama and Miura were still joking around with each other. ÅgSorry, but IÅfm gonna pass for today.Åh 155 4-1 Hayama said that; he seemed to have regrouped. Miura looked at him blankly. And then Hayama made a declaration with a super full-fledged smile across his face: ÅgThis year weÅfre aiming for the Kokuritsu, after all!Åh Huh? Kokuritsu, not Kunitachi? So he wasnÅft talking about Kunitachi, the part of Tokyo that you could reach by the Chuuou line, but rather Kokuritsu? As in, the national tournament? ÅgBwahaÅcÅh I could feel a laugh welling up inside of me. Seeing him act all proud like that, pretending like he said something cool, was seriously justÅc justÅc I couldnÅft take it anymore. It was just so awful. ÅgBut, still, Yumiko. If you eat too much then youÅfre gonna regret it.Åh ÅgYa know, I never get fat no matter how much I eat. Ahh, I guess IÅfll have to go and eat lots today too. Right, Yui?Åh ÅgAhh, yeah, Yumiko sure has really good styleÅc But I have plans right now, so I have to--Åh 156 4-1 ÅgI know, right? Today IÅfm going to have to go eat tons and tons!Åh When Miura said that, laughter erupted around her. It sounded empty, like the kind you'd hear added to a comedy show. The laughs were loud and not much else; I could almost see a caption bar attached to the bottom of the screen. I wasn't trying to listen to their conversation or anything, but they were being so loud that their voices easily reached my ears. Now that you mention it, otaku or riajuu4 that got into a group always got really loud. I was sitting still in the center of the room with nobody around me, but everyone was being so loudÅc It was like I was in the eye of a hurricane. Hayama smiled brightly. That smile made it clear that he was the center of attention, beloved by all. ÅgJust warning ya: donÅft eat so much that your stomach explodes.Åh ÅgLike. I. Said. No matter how much I eat, IÅfm fine! I donÅft get fat. Right, Yui?Åh ÅgAhhh, Yumiko really just has amazing style. And her legs are so pretty. But seriously, I have toÅcÅh ÅgEhh, really? But that Yukinoshita girl has crazy legs too, right?Åh 4 A term referring to people who are doing well and satisfied with their real lives. 157 4-1 ÅgAh, thatÅfs true. YukinonÅfs legs are pretty crazyÅcÅh ÅgÅcÅcÅh ÅgÅcAh, but, I mean, Yumiko definitely stands out a lot more!Åh5 When Miura furrowed her brow, Yuigahama quickly tried to save herself. What the hellÅc It was like watching a queen and her maid. Still, it didnÅft seem like YuigahamaÅfs follow-up was enough to restore her queenÅfs mood. MiuraÅfs eyes narrowed--she did not look pleased. ÅgWell, actually, I think itÅfs fine after allÅc If itÅfs after practice, I can go with you.Åh Hayama might have sensed the tense atmosphere, because he lightly stepped in. The queen seemed to brighten up, smiling. ÅgOkay then, just email me when youÅfre free!Åh Yuigahama smoothed down her chest in furtive relief. 5 She says ÅgflashyÅh here, but that actually has a bit of a negative connotation in English, so I opted for something more positive. 158 4-1 Geez, that looked really painfulÅc Were we back in the damn Middle Ages or something? If a good social life required that much effort, then IÅfd prefer to be alone any day, thank you very much. And then Yuigahama and I made eye contact. She looked at me, then seemed to make up her mind about something. She took a deep breath. ÅgUmm, IÅc have to go somewhere for lunch, soÅcÅh ÅgOh, really? Then make sure you buy some of that stuff when you get back--you know, that lemon tea? I totally forgot to bring something to drink today. And plus, IÅfm having bread, so itÅfs gonna be really rough if I don't have any tea, right?Åh ÅgA-Ah, b-but I might not get back until fifth period, so lunch might have ended, and, ummÅc y'knowÅcÅh When Yuigahama said that, MiuraÅfs face hardened in an instant. Miura looked like she had just gotten bitten by one of her pets. Yuigahama had probably never talked back to Miura before, and yet, on today of all days, she wasnÅft doing what Miura wanted her to. ÅgHuh? Wait, wait, whatÅfs going on? You know, Yui, havenÅft you been staying late after school a lot nowadays? Is it just me, or are you not hanging out with us that much these days?Åh 159 4-1 ÅgAh, well, you know, umm, thereÅfs just some things IÅfm dealing with, and, umm, itÅfs just some personal stuff, and IÅfm really very sorry, but, ummÅcÅh Yuigahama was completely flustered, but she tried to respond. What the hellÅc Was she some office worker getting grilled by her boss or something? However, YuigahamaÅfs response seemed to have the opposite effect. Miura began to tap her nails on her desk, seeming irritated. Their queen's sudden explosion silenced the class. Even Oda and Tahara (or whatever their names were) really dropped the volumes on their PSPs. Hayama and the group's assorted tagalongs all dropped their gazes awkwardly to the floor. The only sound that echoed through the room was the sound of MiuraÅfs nails tapping on her desk. ÅgWell, then how should I know whatÅfs going on? If you want to say something, then just go ahead. WeÅfre friends, arenÅft we? Hiding things from friends, you knowÅc ThatÅfs not good, is it?Åh Yuigahama quickly looked down at the floor. At first, MiuraÅfs words sounded just and proper. In fact, her words only seemed to reinforce the friendship between her and Yuigahama. 160 4-1 They were friends, companions, so they could share everything with each other-- that's what Miura was saying. But her words carried another implication: ÅgAnd if you canÅft share with me, then weÅfre not friends. In fact, we're enemies.Åh It was the Spanish Inquisition all over again. ÅgIÅfm sorryÅcÅh Yuigahama timidly apologized; she was still looking at the floor. ÅgNo no no, thatÅfs not what I want to hear. ThereÅfs something you want to say to me, isnÅft there?Åh There wasnÅft in a person in the world who could actually say something when faced with that. Miura wasnÅft trying to make conversation, and Miura wasnÅft asking a question. She just wanted to make Yuigahama apologize so she could attack her. It was so stupidÅc If you want to kill each other like that, at least do it in private. I turned forward again. Then I began to eat my bread while I fiddled with my phone. I chewed for a bit and took a gulp of my drink. But for some reasonÅc something felt stuck in my throat, and it wasnÅft the bread. ÅcWhy was that, exactly? 161 4-1 Meals are supposed to be times of good cheer. It's like the guy in The Lonely Gourmet. 6 DonÅft get me wrong: I didnÅft want to help that girl in the slightest. ItÅfs just that when a girl you know is close to tears right in front of you, it just makes your stomach churn; your appetite goes to hell. And I really just wanted to enjoy my mealÅc Plus, getting attacked like that was my thing. I wouldnÅft just hand my character trait over to someone else so easily. Ah, and there was one more thing: ÅcI just really didnÅft like that bitch. My desk rattled as I gallantly rose from my chair. ÅgHey, just-Åg ÅgShut the hell up.Åh 6 ÅgKodoku no Gourmet.Åh ItÅfs a manga. 162 4-1 Cut it out. That's what I wanted to say, but before I had the chance, Miura sent a demonic glare my way. ÅgÅcÅcJ-just when is this rain going to stop? I-I sure wish I had brought an umbrella, hahahaÅcÅh Jesus! Was she some kind of anaconda or something?! I really just wanted to apologize then and there! I sank, dejected, into my chair. Miura seemed to have forgotten about my existence; she just looked down on Yuigahama's beaten-down figure. ÅgYou know, IÅfm saying this for YuiÅfs sake, butÅc That wishy-washy attitude of yours really gets on my nerves.Åh She started by saying it was for YuigahamaÅfs sake, but finished with how Miura felt about it. She contradicted herself in just one single sentence. But Miura didnÅft think it was a contradiction--she was the queen of the group, and in that kind of Feudal society, the leader had absolute power. ÅgÅcSorry.Åh ÅgThat again?Åh 163 4-1 Miura's high-handed hmph carried a mix of anger and resignation. That sound alone made Yuigahama shrink down even more. Just cut that crap out already, geezÅc Be more considerate of the people around who have to watch it happen. I canÅft stand this oppressive atmosphereÅc Stop dragging the audience into the youthful drama you people are acting out. I once again mustered the small amount of courage I had. I mean, itÅfs not like they could hate me moreÅc I could head into this battle without any risk, so it wasnÅft too bad of a situation for me. As soon as I stood up to face the back of the class, Yuigahama looked at me with tear-stricken eyes. And, almost as if she was waiting for that exact moment, Miura spoke in a cold voice: ÅgHey, Yui, where are you looking? You know, youÅfve just been apologizing for a whileÅcÅh - ÅgSheÅfs not the one you should be apologizing to, Yuigahama-san.Åh - 164 4-1 The voice that echoed through the room was even icier, even crueler, than MiuraÅfs voice had been. Everyone who heard it cowered. That voice blew like a fierce wind from the North Pole, but that voice was also just as beautiful as an aurora. She stood in the corner of the classroom, in front of the door, and yet she drew everyone's gaze immediately, as if she was the center of the entire world. Of all the people on this planet, only Yukinoshita Yukino could sound like that. I was suddenly paralyzed, and found myself completely stuck in my half-standing position. Compared to that, MiuraÅfs last attempts at intimidation seemed like childÅfs play. After all, when Yukinoshita was your opponent, you didnÅft even have a chance to be afraid. It was something that went so far beyond fear that you were left with only an impression of beauty. And so everyone in the classroom became enthralled at the sight of that girl. At some point, even the sound of MiuraÅfs nails tapping on the desk disappeared, and the classroom fell into complete silence. But YukinoshitaÅfs voice soon shattered that silence. ÅgYuigahama-sanÅc It really is quite something. You told me to wait for you somewhere, and yet you did not even show up at the appointed time. WouldnÅft it have been proper to at least text me that you would be late?Åh 165 4-1 When Yuigahama heard that, she smiled, seeming relieved. She began to head towards Yukinoshita. ÅgÅcS-sorry. But, umm, I donÅft actually have YukinonÅfs phone numberÅcÅh ÅgÅcIs that so? I suppose that's trueÅc Well then, I wonÅft say youÅfre one hundred percent responsible. IÅfll let this one slide.Åh Yukinoshita seemed to pay no heed to events around her, simply continuing to say whatever she wanted. It was almost refreshing to see her simply continue on at her own pace. ÅgW-wait just a sec! WeÅfre still talking here!Åh It seemed Miura was finally freed from her paralysis, and she flared up at Yukinoshita and Yuigahama. The Queen of FireÅfs anger thundered, and her flames became hotter and hotter. ÅgWhat is it? I donÅft have much time to stay and talk with you--I still havenÅft eaten my lunch.Åh ÅgH-huh? You show up all of a sudden and then you say that? IÅfm talking with Yui here!Åh 166 4-1 ÅgTalking with her? WerenÅft you just yelling? Was that supposed to be a conversation? To me, it just seemed that you were trying to get her off-balance and then unilaterally push your own opinion on her.Åh ÅgWha-?!?!Åh ÅgI'm sorry I didnÅft realize it soonerÅc I admit that IÅfm not too aware of your typeÅfs way of life, so I couldnÅft help but compare it to an ape's dominance games." Even the Queen of Fire was freezing over when faced with the Queen of Ice. ÅgOoooÅcÅh Miura glared at Yukinoshita, her anger completely obvious. However, Yukinoshita let her glare pass with indifference. ÅgYou can huff and puff all you like, and you can act like youÅfre the king of the castle, but please do that privately and on your own time. Otherwise, your little act will fall apart, just like your makeup is right now.Åh ÅgÅcHuh, what are you saying? I don't get it.Åh 167 4-1 168 4-1 Miura, sounding like a bit of a sore loser, finally seemed to collapse back down into her chair. Her curly locks of hair swayed from side to side as she began to furiously fiddle with her cell phone. After all that, not a single person tried to talk to that girl. Even Hayama, who was usually good at keeping up with situations like this, could only yawn to try and diffuse the awkwardness. And right next to all that was Yuigahama, still standing stock still. She was gripping her skirt hem tightly, as if she wanted to say something. Yukinoshita may have guessed what Yuigahama wanted to do, because she began to walk out of the room. ÅgIÅfm going on ahead.Åh ÅgI-IÅfm coming tooÅcÅh ÅgÅcDo as you please.Åh ÅgOkay.Åh When Yuigahama heard that, she let out a smile, butÅc She was the only one smiling. 169 4-1 Hey, hey, what the hell was up with this atmosphereÅc The situation was insanely uncomfortable, so it was really hard to stay in the classroom. Before I knew it, more than half my classmates had begun to leave the room, saying that they were thirsty or that they needed to use the restrooms. The only ones left there, other than Hayama and MiuraÅfs group, were the more overly-curious members of the class. I supposed that I also had to take a chance and ride that big wave right out the door! But, seriouslyÅc If the atmosphere got any darker in there, then I would suffocate and die. I began to walk, as quietly as possible, toward the door, passing by Yuigahama on the way. And at that point, I heard a small whisper: ÅgThanks for standing up back there.Åh 170 4-2 4-2 When I left the classroom, I saw Yukinoshita there. She was leaning against the wall right next to the door with crossed arms and closed eyes. She was giving off an extremely cold aura, and that might be why no one else was around. It was very quiet. And that's why I could hear the conversation happening inside the classroom: ÅgÅc Umm, IÅfm sorry. You know, I get a bit uneasy when I canÅft get along with someoneÅc Or you could say I just get really self-conscious all of a suddenÅc so maybe you're annoyed by that.Åh ÅgÅcÅcÅcÅh ÅgUhhh, well, how should I put it? IÅfve always been like that. Even when I played Ojamajo-pretend with my friends, I wanted to be Doremi or Onpu-chan, but another girl wanted to be those, so I ended up being HazukiÅc1 I grew up in a big apartment complex with other people around me all the time, so maybe that's why I thought that was the best way to actÅcÅh ÅgI have no idea what youÅfre trying to say.Åh 1 A reference to Ojamajo Doremi characters. Hey, did you know our group also does the translation for this series? You can check it out here! 171 4-2 ÅgY-Yeah, I guess so, haha. Well, I donÅft really know what IÅfm saying eitherÅc ItÅfs just, umm, when I saw Hikki and Yukinon I realized something. Even when there's nobody around you, you still look like youÅfre having funÅc You two say what you're thinking, and even though you donÅft usually get along, you seem to mesh somehowÅcÅh Every once in a while, I could hear something like sobs from inside the classroom. Every time that happened, I could see YukinoshitaÅfs shoulders twitch. She widened her eyes just a little and tried to look inside the classroom without turning her head. You idiot, you wonÅft be able to see anything from there. If youÅfre that worried, then go in the damn room. That girlÅc She's really not honest with herself. ÅgAfter I saw that, I started to think that maybe it was wrong for me to always desperately try to get along with everyoneÅc I mean, to be honest, Hikki is seriously a Hikki. During breaks heÅfs just off by himself reading books and gigglingÅc ItÅfs gross, but he looks like heÅfs having fun.Åh Gross, she saysÅc Once Yukinoshita heard that, she let out a chuckle. ÅgI thought that you only had that weird habit in the clubroom, but it looks like you do that in the classroom too. ThatÅfs seriously a disgusting habit--you should just cut it out.Åh ÅgIf you knew about that already, then you should have told meÅcÅh 172 4-2 ÅgBut it's only natural that I didnÅft. Who would want to talk to you after you do something that disgusting?Åh I'll seriously attempt to be more careful from now on, then. IÅfm not going to read any more light novels about evil gods at school.2 ÅhSo I thought, maybe I shouldnÅft try so hard, I'll just take it a bit more easyÅc Or something like that. But itÅfs not like I hate Yumiko or something. We can still get alongÅc a lotÅc after this, right?Åh ÅhÅcHmph. I see. Well then, whatever. ThatÅfs fine.Åh I heard the sound of Miura snapping her phone closed. ÅhÅcSorry again. Thanks.Åh And with that, the conversation in the room stopped, and I heard the pitter patter of YuigahamaÅfs shoes walking towards us. Taking that sound as a signal, Yukinoshita also stopped leaning on the wall and stood up. ÅgÅc Well, what do you know. She can stand up for herself.Åh 2 IÅfm not super sure, but this might be a reference to Yamunaku Kakusei! Jashin Oonuma, which is also a light novel published by the same publishing house. (Jashin means evil God). 173 4-2 For that brief moment, I was taken aback by the brief glimpse of a smile on YukinoshitaÅfs face. It was a smile, simple, pure, devoid of mockery or sarcasm or sorrow. However, that smile soon vanished, and YukinoshitaÅfs expression returned to its usual, icy state. While I was staring at YukinoshitaÅfs smile, she quickly walked off to the other end of the hallway and disappeared, paying me no attention whatsoever. She was probably heading towards the meeting place she and Yuigahama had agreed on. ÅcWell then, what should I do next? I began to walk off, but at that moment, the classroom door opened. ÅgEh? W-why is Hikki standing right here?Åh I was frozen stiff, but I managed to lift up my right arm and greet her, hoping I could get out of this situation. As I looked at YuigahamaÅfs face, I could see she was getting redder and redder. ÅgWere you listening?Åh ÅgW-whatever could you meanÅc?Åh 174 4-2 ÅgYou were listening werenÅft you? You were eavesdropping?! Gross! Stalker! Weirdo! Um ummÅc so gross! I canÅft believe you! YouÅfre seriously gross. YouÅfre seriously, truly gross.Åh ÅgJust hold on! Show some restraint!Åh I mean, even I'll get sad if you throw so much abuse right in my face. And donÅft say that last part with a completely serious expression, dammitÅc I think IÅfm really wounded now. ÅgHmph, itÅfs a bit too late for me to show restraint. And whose fault do you think that is? Idiot.Åh Yuigahama stuck out her sakura-colored tongue out at me, and with that cute attempt to provoke me, she ran off. Was she an elementary schooler or something? DonÅft run in the halls, dammit. ÅgWhose faultÅc It was YukinoshitaÅfs fault, right?Åh I was talking to myself. I was alone, so that was only natural. When I looked at the clock, I saw that there was only a little time left in our break. That awfully thirst-inducing lunch break was also already over. Maybe I should go buy some Sportop to quench the thirst in my throat and in my heart. 175 4-2 As I headed for the vending machine, I suddenly realized something: Otaku had otaku communities, so they werenÅft alone. And becoming a riajuu meant that you had to pay a lot of attention to the pecking order and balance of power, so it was really tough. So in the end, I was the only person who was alone. I didnÅft need Hiratsuka-sensei to isolate me, because I was already isolated in my classÅc So there really wasnÅft a point in trying to isolate me further in the service club. ÅcWhat a sad conclusion that was. Reality was way too cruel. The only sweet thing in my life was the taste of this Sportop. 176 5-1 5: To sum up, Zaimokuza Yoshiteru is a bit off. It might be a little too late to describe how the service club worked, but we were supposed to listen to the problems of students and then try to help them out. If I didnÅft remind myself every now and then, I really would forget what this club was for. Most of the time, Yukinoshita and I just sat and read books. And Yuigahama just played around with her phone. ÅgHmÅc Ah, why exactly are you here again?Åh She blended in so well that we never questioned her presence, but that didnÅft mean Yuigahama was a member of the service club. Actually, I wasnÅft even sure if I was a member of this club. Was I, really? Either way, I kinda wanted to quitÅc ÅgHuh? Ah, I mean, I just had a lot of free time today, y'know?Åh ÅgÅfY'knowÅf? Even if you say that, I still don't know. Also, what the hell--you from Hiroshima or something?Åh1 ÅgHuh? Hiroshima? IÅfm from Chiba.Åh 1 What now follows is a page of discussion on Japanese dialects. Please take pity on your poor translator who will do his best to get through this section in English without making things sound incoherent. 177 5-1 Well, in reality, people who spoke the Hiroshima dialect added Ågy'knowÅh to the end of things, but a lot of people seemed surprised when I told them that. I had a pretty horrible image in my mind of how guys from Hiroshima sounded, but girls who spoke with an authentic Hiroshima accent were really cute. In fact, that accent would rank amongst my top ten for cutest accents. ÅgHmph. You were born in Chiba, but don't go thinking that makes it okay for you to say youÅfre Åefrom Chiba.ÅfÅh ÅgHey, Hikigaya-kun. I really have no idea what youÅfre trying to say right nowÅcÅh Yukinoshita gave me an incredibly scornful look. I ignored her. ÅgLetÅfs go then, Yuigahama. First question: what do you call it when you get hit so hard that you have internal bleeding?Åh ÅgA black-and-blue!Åh2 ÅgHmÅc ThatÅfs the correct answer. To think you also understand the Chiba dialectÅc All right then, on to question two. If you could pick a side dish to go with your lunch, what would it be?Åh 2 Yeah they didnÅft say this at all. They actually talk about different ways of saying the word ÅgbruiseÅh in Japanese dialects. But because there is no common variation on the word ÅgbruiseÅh in English dialects, I chose to just change the text around and go with something that does have common dialectical differences in English. 178 5-1 ÅgMiso peanuts!Åh ÅgHmmmÅc Maybe you really are from ChibaÅcÅh ÅgThatÅfs what IÅfve been saying, y'know?Åh Yuigahama put her arms on her hips and tilted her head to the side, as if to say, ÅgWhat in the world is this guy on about?Åh Yukinoshita was next to her with her elbow resting on the table and her hand on her forehead. She let out a sigh. ÅgÅcHey, what was that all of a sudden? Was there a point to that exchange?Åh Of course there was no point. ÅgIt was just the Trans-Chiba Prefecture Ultra Quiz.3 To be more concrete, by ÅeTransÅf I mean going from Matsudo to Choushi.Åh4 ÅgThat doesnÅft cover a lot at all!Åh ÅgFine, fine, then we can make it from Sawara to Tateyama.Åh 3 A parody of the Trans-America Ultra Quiz, a Japanese game show. 4 If you plotted this on a map, this basically crosses the very top of Chiba Prefecture, and misses the bottom 80 percent of the prefecture. 179 5-1 ÅgSo youÅfre going from top to bottomÅcÅh ÅcYou two, how do you get all that from just the city names? Do you really like Chiba that much? ÅgWell then, third question: if you ride on the Sotobou Line towards Toke, then what do you call the strange animal that (for whatever reason) suddenly appears?Åh ÅgAh, speaking of Matsudo, Yukinon, I hear that there are a lot of ramen shops over there. LetÅfs go sometime.Åh ÅgRamenÅc I havenÅft had ramen too often, so I donÅft really know--Åh ÅgItÅfs fine, itÅfs fine! I havenÅft had ramen much either!Åh ÅgÅcEh? How does that make it fine? Could you please explain that a bit more?Åh ÅgHmm, and also, what was it about MatsudoÅc? Right, there was this shop named Nantoka that they say is really goodÅcÅh ÅgAre you listening to what IÅfm saying?Åh 180 5-1 ÅgHm? Yeah, I am. Ah, but there are good shops around here tooÅc This is all near my house, so IÅfm super knowledgeable about this area. My house is like five minutes away from here, you see. And thereÅfs this shop here that I pass by all the time when IÅfm walking my dog.Åh ÅcÅcThe correct answer was Åeostrich.Åf If youÅfre riding on a train and you suddenly see an ostrich outside your window, I guess that you wouldn't really be surprised, youÅfd just be pretty impressed. Sigh. I left the two girls to their (rather mismatched) conversation about ramen and went back to my book. There were three people here and I was still alone. What the hell was that about? But, well, I guess spending time like this did make me feel like a normal high school student. Compared to middle schoolers, high schoolers had more freedoms, so they tended to be interested in trends and food. So this ramen conversation did feel like a very high school conversation. ÅcThough, granted, most high schoolers don't do things like the Trans-Chiba Prefecture Ultra Quiz. 181 5-2 5-2 It was the next day. When I headed for the club room, I was surprised to see Yukinoshita and Yuigahama both standing in front of the door. I wondered what in the world they were doing until I saw that, for some reason, the door was ajar and they were peeking inside. ÅgWhat are you two doing?Åh ÅgHyahh!Åh I heard that cute scream, and at the same time the two girls jumped in shock. ÅgHikigaya-kunÅc You surprised meÅcÅh ÅgIÅfm the one whoÅfs surprised hereÅcÅh What kind of reaction was that? It reminded me of what happens if I come across my familyÅfs pet cat in the living room during the middle of the night. ÅgCould you not suddenly call out to us like that?Åh 182 5-2 Yukinoshita's irritated glare also perfectly resembled our cat. Now that I think about it, that cat is pretty friendly with everyone else in my familyÅc That's one more way that Yukinoshita really reminded me of that animal. ÅgWell, sorry. So, what are you doing?Åh Yuigahama had once again slightly opened the clubroom door and was quietly peeking in. When I spoke up, she was the one who answered me. ÅgThereÅfs a suspicious person in the clubroom.Åh ÅgYou two are the suspicious ones hereÅcÅh ÅgQuiet--that's enough. Would you be so kind as to go in and see who this person is?Åh Yukinoshita ordered me with a testy look on her face. I did as I was told, stepping in front of the two girls and carefully opening the door. I entered the room. Inside, waiting for us, was the wind. 183 5-2 As soon as I opened the door, we were met by a breeze. It was a breeze typical of this near-the-sea school, and as it whirled around the clubroom, it sent papers flying. The spectacle reminded me of those magic tricks where many white doves flew out of a magicianÅfs silk hat. And there, in the center of that world of white, stood one person. ÅgKu ku ku, to think we would meet at a place like thisÅc What a surprise. IÅfve been waiting for you, Hikigaya Hachiman.Åh ÅgW-what did you say?!Åh He'd waited for me, and he was surprisedÅc? What the hell was with that? If anyone should be surprised, it was me. I pushed my way through the whirling white papers to get a good look at my opponent. And so, standing there, I sawÅc Ugh, no, never mind, never mind. I didn't want anything to do with Zaimokuza Yoshiteru. Well, granted, I donÅft have much to do with most people in this schoolÅc But even amongst all those people, this guy was the person I least wanted to see. 184 5-2 I mean, look at him--he was sweating like it was summer, thanks to his damn coat and those fingerless gloves. Even if I knew him, I was going to pretend I didnÅft. ÅgHikigaya-kun, that one over there seems to know youÅcÅh Yukinoshita, who was hiding behind me, looked suspiciously back and forth between me and Ågthat thing over there.Åh Zaimokuza seemed to cower for a moment under her ill-mannered stare, but he soon returned his gaze to me. Then he crossed his arms and began to laugh once again in his low voice. He used exaggerated motions, shrugging his shoulders and slowly shaking his head. ÅgTo think that you would forget your old partnerÅc How low of you, Hachiman.Åh ÅgHeÅfs calling you his old partnerÅcÅh Yuigahama gave me a cold look, the kind of look that said, ÅgGo die, you pieces of garbage.Åh ÅgIndeed, old partner. You still remember, do you not? How we braved those hellish times togetherÅcÅh 185 5-2 ÅgThey paired us up in gym class. That was itÅcÅh I couldnÅft bear to just go along with it any longer, and Zaimokuza grimaced. ÅgHmph. Customs so evil as that may only be called hell. Pair up with whomever you like, they say? Ku ku ku, as if I desire friendship with this ephemeral body of mine! ÅcAs if I ever wish to experience a parting that will tear that body apart! If that is love, then I have no need for love!Åh He stared off into the distance out the window. Surely there was some lovely princessÅfs image floating up there, in that empty skyÅc Or maybe everyone liked Fist of the North Star way too damn much. Well, now that weÅfd come this far, you can probably tell how sharp this guy was. You could probably tell that he was one of those people. ÅgWhat do you want, Zaimokuza?Åh ÅgHng, so you speak the name engraved in my soulÅc Indeed, it is I, the master fencer general, Zaimokuza Yoshiteru.Åh He flashily fluttered his coat, and as he looked back in our direction, he put a gallant expression on his chubby face. It seemed he had fallen completely into acting out the master fencer general character he had created. 186 5-2 Just looking at him made a throbbing pain run through my headÅc But maybe I should say that the throbbing pain was in my heart. More importantly, the stares of Yukinoshita and Yuigahama hurt even more than that. ÅgHeyÅc What exactly is that supposed to be?Åh Yuigahama looked clearly irritatedÅc Should I say unhappy? Åcand she was glaring at me. But, seriously, why in the world are you glaring at me? ÅgThis guy is Zaimokuza YoshiteruÅc We used to be gym partners.Åh Honestly, that's all it was. My relationship with Zaimokuza extended no further than thatÅc Though itÅfs not completely wrong to say that we were, in some sense, partners who had banded together to push through hellish times. It truly is hell to pair up with friends. Zaimokuza went through that same pain, and so he also understood how terrible those times were. Ever since the first gym class, where Zaimokuza and I were paired up because we had been the only ones left over, we were always put together. To be honest, I 187 5-2 really wanted to trade that huge chuunibyou1 oaf off to some other team, but I couldnÅft manage it, so I gave up. I also considered declaring myself a free agent, but unfortunately, someone of my level is just too expensive to hire, so that didnÅft work out eitherÅc Okay, fine, fine, I lied--Zaimokuza and I were just the only ones who didnÅft have friends. As Yukinoshita listened to my explanation, she looked back and forth between me and Zaimokuza. That seemed to satisfy her, and she nodded. ÅgBirds of a feather flock together, donÅft they?Åh Naturally, she came to the absolute worst conclusion possible. ÅgYou idiot, donÅft lump me together with himÅc IÅfm not that much of a lost cause yet. First of all, weÅfre not even friends, dammit.Åh ÅgHmph, I would have to agree. Indeed, I do not have any friendsÅc IÅfm seriously alone, sniff.Åh Zaimokuza spoke in a sad, self-derisive tone. Hey, look, heÅfs back to normal againÅc 1 Chuunibyou refers to (relatively) mature people who are overly absorbed in fantasy worlds, often pretending they are some fictional character that only exists in their heads. 188 5-2 ÅgWell, it doesnÅft matter. Your friend there seems to want something from you, doesnÅft he?Åh Yukinoshita's words almost made me want to cry. The word ÅgfriendÅh hadnÅft made me so sad since middle schoolÅc It hadnÅft made me that sad since the time I heard it from Kaori-chan in middle schoolÅc ÅgI like Hikigaya-kun and youÅfre really nice, but going out with you is a bitÅc CanÅft we just be friends?Åh I really donÅft need friends like thatÅc ÅgMwahaha, I've wiped that from my memory. By the way, Hachiman. This is the service club, is it not?Åh Zaimokuza had gotten back into character, laughing strangely and looking at me. What the hell was that laugh supposed to be? ThatÅfs the first time IÅfve heard something like that. ÅgYeah, this is the service club.Åh Yukinoshita answered in my place. When she did that, Zaimokuza looked over at Yukinoshita for a brief second before immediately returning his gaze to me. Why the hell did he have to look at me? 189 5-2 ÅgÅcI-is that so? Therefore, if Hiratsuka-sensei spoke true, Hachiman, you have a duty to grant my wishes, do you not? To think that after so many hundreds of years you would once again return to my serviceÅc This must be the work of the Hachiman Great Bodhisattva.2 Åh ÅgItÅfs not like the service club is here to grant your wishesÅc We just help you out a bit.Åh ÅgÅcH-hm. Then, Hachiman, lend me your hand. Fu fu fu, now that I think about itÅc We are equals, are we not? Equals who, just as in times of old, will seek to conquer all that lies under heaven!Åh ÅgWhatever happened to that whole ÅeservantÅf angle? Also, why the hell are you only looking at me?Åh ÅgAh-ahem! Such trifling matters do not concern people such as us! I will make a special exception in this case.Åh Zaimokuza coughed in a completely ridiculous way, perhaps to try and cover up his fumble. And then, of course, he looked right back at me. 2 The Hachiman Great Bodhisattva is a deity of archery and war in Japanese mythology. And yes, also happens to be the name of the main character in this novel. 190 5-2 ÅgI apologize. It simply seems that the hearts of man have fallen from the ways of the days of yore. Oh, how I miss the pure times of the Muromachi Era3 Åc Do you not feel the same, Hachiman?Åh ÅgAbsolutely not. And seriously, go die.Åh ÅgKu ku ku. As if death can scare meÅc It would just grant me a whole new world to conquer!Åh Zaimokuza lifted his arms high, his coat fluttering in the breeze. He really had a huge tolerance for people telling him to dieÅc I was the sameÅc I guess that when you got used to insults and abuse being flung your way, you got good at retorting or dealing with it. It was a very sad skill to haveÅc It really brought me to tears. ÅgUwahhÅcÅh Yuigahama seemed seriously repulsed. Her face even seemed a bit pale to me. ÅgHikigaya-kun, could I speak with you for just a momentÅc?Åh 3 The period between around 1400 to 1600 in Japanese history. Overlaps quite heavily with the Warring States Era. 191 5-2 After saying that, Yukinoshita pulled on my sleeve and whispered in my ear. ÅgWhat is going on? What is up with this master fencer general whatever?Åh YukinoshitaÅfs cute face was very close to mine and she was giving off a pleasant scent, but her voice didnÅft have a single ounce of seductiveness in it. Faced with that, I felt it was more than enough to answer with a single sentence: ÅgThat is chuunibyou. Just chuunibyou.Åh ÅgChoo-nee-byou?Åh Yukinoshita looked at me, tilting her head to the side. I just noticed it, but when girls say the syllable Ågchoo,Åh4 their lips are really cuteÅc What a strange discovery. Yuigahama, who also trying to listen in to our conversation, joined in. ÅgThat some kind of disease?Åh ÅgItÅfs not like itÅfs a real diseaseÅc Just think of it as a slang term.Åh 4 In Japanese, ÅgchuuÅh (pronounced like ÅgchooÅh) means kiss. 192 5-2 In short, chuunibyou referred to a sequence of really embarrassingly painful behaviors often seen in middle schoolers. And even amongst those people, Zaimokuza was a particularly bad case, deserving of the title of Ågjakigan.Åh5 These were people who yearned for the abilities and strange powers they saw in manga, anime, and games, and behaved as if they had those abilities. Of course, if they had those abilities, then they also had to make up stories to make such powers plausible, so they often pretended to be the reincarnation of some warrior of legend, or some human chosen by the gods, or some secret agent. And then they acted in accordance with that backstory. Why did they do things like that? Because it was cool. Well, granted, I think that anyone whoÅfs been through middle school has thought that way at least once. I think that everyone, at some point, has stood in front of the mirror and said something like, ÅgGood evening to everyone tuning into Countdown TV.6 Umm, this time we have a new song about true love, and IÅfve written the lyricsÅcÅh In essence, chuunibyou was the most extreme example of that. 5 ÅgJakigan,Åh literally Ågevil eye,Åh is another word that can be applied to chuunibyou. It is a derogatory reference to the Ågthird eyesÅh that characters have which grant them special powers in many action series aimed at younger audiences. 6 Countdown TV is a Japanese late night music TV show. 193 5-2 And so I briefly explained what chuunibyou was, and Yukinoshita seemed satisfied with that. I think this every single time, but I always truly admire how quickly this girlÅfs mind can turn--itÅfs almost as if I can say just one thing and sheÅfs already ten steps ahead of me. She never even needs that much explanation to understand the heart of a situation. ÅgI have no idea whatÅfs going onÅcÅh In stark contrast to Yukinoshita, Yuigahama didnÅft seem very happy; she was muttering blankly. To be fair, I donÅft think that I would understand either if I had only heard my explanationÅc Honestly, understanding that quickly made Yukinoshita the strange one. ÅgHm, so itÅfs like using some backstory you dreamed up and putting on a play based on that, right?Åh ÅgThatÅfs pretty much it. In his case, he seems to have used Ashikaga Yoshiteru, the thirteenth-generation shogun of the Muromachi Bakufu, as his basis. It was probably easier that way, since they share a given name.Åh ÅgSo why does he consider you his companion?Åh 194 5-2 ÅgHe probably took Hachiman and turned it into the Hachiman Great Bodhisattva, didnÅft he? The Seiwa Genji7 worshipped him fervently as a god of war. YouÅfve heard of the Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine, right?8 Åh After I responded, Yukinoshita suddenly fell into silence. What was wrong? I gave her a questioning look, and I saw that she was staring at me with wide eyes. ÅgIÅfm surprised. YouÅfre quite informed.Åh ÅgÅcYeah, I guess.Åh Unpleasant memories were about to resurface, so I suddenly turned my head away. Then I took the chance to change the subject. ÅgZaimokuza's way of bringing up every little piece of historical trivia gets really annoying, but at least heÅfs basing his character on real history.Åh Hearing that, Yukinoshita glanced briefly at Zaikomokuza and questioned me with a genuine look of displeasure on her face. ÅgÅcYouÅfre saying there are ones worse than that?Åh 7 A famous line of rulers of the Minamoto clan, one of whom is Tokugawa Ieyasu, the shogun who united Japan after the Warring States era and kicked off what is considered to be early modern Japan. Ashikaga Yoshiteru is also (probably?) considered to be part of this line. 8 Most famous shrine in the city of Kamakura, and of course one meant to worship the deity Hachiman. 195 5-2 ÅgYes.Åh ÅgSo, just for my personal reference, what kinds of people are those?Åh ÅgIn the beginning, there were seven gods in this world. There are the three gods of creation, the Wise Emperor Garin, the Warrior Goddess Mythica, and Heartia, the Protector of Souls. There are the three gods of destruction, the King of Fools Ortho, the Lost Temple Rogue, and the Deity of False Suspicions Lailai. And then there is also the Eternally Absent God with No Name. From the beginning of time, those seven gods have repeatedly brought prosperity and then destruction to the world. Presently, the world has already lived through that cycle six times, and this time the Japanese government is trying to prevent the worldÅfs destruction by finding the reincarnated bodies of those gods. Among those seven gods, the most important is the Eternally Absent God with No Name, whose powers are still not fully understood, and I, Hikig-Åc whoa, youÅfre really good at leading questions, arenÅft you?! Hahaha, IÅfm seriously shaking, you almost got me to spill all the beans there!Åh ÅgBut I wasnÅft trying to lead you in any wayÅcÅh ÅgDisgustingÅcÅh ÅgYuigahama, be careful what you say. You might find yourself accidentally committing suicide one day.Åh 196 5-2 Yukinoshita let out an exasperated sigh, and then looked back and forth again between me and Zaimokuza before speaking again. ÅgIn other words, Hikigaya-kun is in the same class as that one over there. ThatÅfs why heÅfs so informed when it comes to this master fencer general or whatever it is.Åh ÅgNo no no, what are you saying, Yukinoshita-san? Of course that isnÅft true, Yukinoshita-san. Of course thereÅfs a reason IÅfm so informedÅc ItÅfs because I chose to take Japanese history, you know? ItÅfs because I played NobunagaÅfs Ambition9 , you know?Åh ÅgRightÅcÅh Yukinoshita gave me a doubtful look. It seemed that I was guilty until proven innocent. But I didnÅft back off. I wasnÅft the same as Zaimokuza, so I could look Yukinoshita straight back in her eyes with confidence. Because what she said was not exactly true: Indeed, I wasnÅft the same as ZaimokuzaÅc any longer. 9 Turn based strategy game which has groundings in Japanese history. 197 5-2 The name ÅgHachimanÅh is fairly uncommon, so there was a time during my childhood when I wondered whether I was some kind of special existence. I also liked anime and manga back then, so it was pretty natural to fall into that kind of delusion. As I lay in my futon, I would pretend that there was some amazing power lying hidden within me, and that, someday, those powers would suddenly awaken. When that day came, I would be pitched into a battle for the fate of the world. In preparation for that day, I even kept a spirit world diary, and I would write a report to send to the government every three months. Everyone did that kind of stuff though, right? ÅcThey donÅftÅc? ÅgÅc Well, how should I put itÅc? In the past we were probably the same, but we're different now.Åh ÅgHm, I wonderÅcÅh Yukinoshita gave me a teasing smile and walked away from me, heading for Zaimokuza. As I watched her retreating back, a thought suddenly struck me: Was I really different now from Zaimokuza? The answer was yes. 198 5-2 I didnÅft have idiotic daydreams any longer, and I didnÅft write spirit world diaries or government reports either. The only thing IÅfd written recently was a ÅgList of People I Will Never Forgive.Åh Naturally, the first person on that list was Yukinosihta. I didnÅft play around with Gundam figures while making sound effects with my own mouth any more, and I didnÅft screw around with clothespins trying to make the strongest robot10. I also outgrew using rubber bands and aluminum foil to make self-defense weapons. And IÅfve also stopped trying to cosplay with my dadÅfs coat and my momÅfs fake fur. I was different from Zaimokuza. By the time I'd managed to get over my indecisiveness and reach that conclusion, Yukinoshita was already standing right in front of Zaimokuza. Yuigahama was loudly whispering, ÅgYukinon, run away!Åh Ugh, poor guyÅc ÅgI think I understand. YouÅfre here so we can help you cure this sickness, am I correct?Åh ÅgÅcHachiman. I have joined you here to see if you will abide by your oath to grant our wishes. It is but a single, sublime desire.Åh 10 I seriously didnÅft know this was a thing, but apparently it is. 199 5-2 Zaimokuza averted his gaze from Yukinoshita and looked at me. He'd definitely switched between first person and the royal ÅgweÅh just thenÅc How confused was this person? Then I realized something. That guyÅc Every time Yukinoshita spoke to him, he definitely turned toward me instead. Well, itÅfs not like I didnÅft sympathizeÅc Before I learned what kind of person Yukinoshita really was, I also got flustered every time she talked to me. Back then, I couldnÅft even properly look her in the eye. But Yukinoshita did not have a normal person's sensitivity, and was not the type who would accommodate those types of manly anxieties. ÅgIÅfm the one talking here. When someone speaks to you, you should try and face that person directly.Åh Yukinoshita spoke in a cold voice as she grabbed Zaimokuza by the collar, forcing him to face her straight on. Indeed. Yukinoshita herself had no manners, but she was really annoying when it came to the manners of others. It had gotten to the point where even I made sure I properly greeted her every time I went to the clubroom. 200 5-2 When Yukinoshita released ZaimokuzaÅfs collar, he began to cough severely. It really wasn't a good time for him to try and stay in character. ÅgÅc M-MwahahahaÅc By JoveÅcÅh ÅgAdditionally, stop talking like that.Åh ÅgÅcÅcÅh Yukinoshita struck him down, and so the silenced Zaimokuza looked down at the ground. ÅgWhy are you wearing a coat in this season?Åh ÅgÅc H-hmph. This cloak, as one of my twelve divine instruments, protects me from the demonic energies of this world. But each time I reincarnate into this world, it is this cloak that allows me to choose the most appropriate form to take. Fuwahahaha!Åh ÅgStop talking like that.Åh ÅgAh, okayÅcÅh 201 5-2 ÅgSo, why are you wearing fingerless gloves? Is there a point to that? Those wonÅft protect your fingers.Åh ÅgÅcAh, yes. UmmÅc These are an inheritance of my previous incarnation, and together, they are one of my twelve divine instruments. This special armor shoots out diamonds, and so I may more easily wield their power in combat, I let my fingers out into the openÅc Indeed! Fuwahahaha!Åh ÅgYou're talking like that again.Åh ÅgHahaha! HahahaÅc hahÅcÅh Zaimokuza started with a boisterous laugh, but it soon devolved into a slightly tearful sigh. And then he once again fell into silence. Perhaps she took pity on him at that point, butÅc Yukinoshita suddenly changed course, putting on a kind-looking expression. ÅgIn any case, is it fine if we simply say that you want this disease cured?Åh ÅgÅcAh, itÅfs not really a disease thoughÅcÅh 202 5-2 Zaimokuza, who still wasnÅft looking Yukinoshita in the eye, spoke in a very small voice. He just glanced at me every now and then with a troubled expression on his face. He had completely returned to his true self. It seemed that Zaimokuza was incapable of staying in character while subject to YukinoshitaÅfs sparkling gaze. Ugh! I couldn't watch it any longer! Zaimokuza was way too pitiful. It made me want to throw him some sort of lifeline. I decided that the best first step would be to separate Zaimokuza and Yukinoshita, and therefore I took a step towards themÅc But I felt myself step on something. It was one of the papers that had been flown through the room earlier. When I picked it up, I saw a bunch of insanely difficult kanji lined up. That piece of paper completely stole my focus. ÅgThis isÅcÅh I raised my gaze from the page and looked into the middle of the room. These pages, typeset with forty-two words on each of the thirty-four lines, were 203 5-2 scattered all throughout the room. I picked them up one by one and began to arrange them in sequential order. ÅgHm, as expectedÅc I didnÅft have to say a word for you to realize it. Truly this is proof that there was value in our struggles against those hellish times.Åh Zaimokuza spoke with quite a lot of emotion in his voice, but I ignored him. Yuigahama looked at the papers I held in my hands. ÅgWhatÅfs that?Åh I passed her the bundle of papers and she began to flip through them, checking their contents. I could almost see a question mark floating above her head as she tried to read the pages, but she finally gave out a long sigh and passed the papers back to me. ÅgWhatÅfs this?Åh ÅgA draft of a novelÅc I think.Åh In response, Zaimokuza cleared his throat as if trying to reset the conversation. 204 5-2 ÅgI am grateful for your keen insight. Indeed, that is a manuscript for a light novel. I intend to apply to a certain novel competition for new authors, but I have no friends, and so I have no second opinions. Read that, if you would.Åh ÅgFor some reason, I get the feeling that there was something really sad in the middle of thatÅcÅh You could say that the desire to be a light novel author was a natural symptom of chuunibyou. It was natural that they'd want to bring their imagination to life. And it wasnÅft strange for those overimaginative chuunibyou to believe that they would make good novelists. And of course it was a happy thing to be able to earn a living with something you loved. So if Zaimokuza wanted to be a light novel author, then that was normal. Coming all this way to show his work to us, on the other hand, was not normal. ÅgThere are sites where you can put this kind of stuff up and ask for feedback, so why donÅft you just try one of those?Åh ÅgNo use--those people have no mercy. Too much criticism. I would probably die.Åh ÅcWhat a weakling. 205 5-2 But certainly, on the internet others show no. restraint at all. They'll say what they want, whereas your friends would be more considerate of your feelings and try to say stuff to make you feel better about yourself. Generally speaking, considering our relationship with Zaimokuza, we couldn't be too strict with him. It's definitely difficult to dole out a harsh critique when you're looking at the other person in the eye. We would probably have to go at it in a really roundabout way instead. Normally, anywayÅc ÅgBut thenÅcÅh I glanced to my side and let out half a sigh. I met YukinoshitaÅfs gaze; she had a blank look on her face. ÅgYukinoshita is probably going to be harsher than the people online, you know?Åh 206 5-3 5-3 Yukinoshita, Yuigahama, and I each took a copy of Zaimokuza's manuscript with us. We'd decided we would spend a night reading it. If I were to slap a label onto ZaimokuzaÅfs light novel, I would call it a superhuman action novel set in a school. It took place in a certain small city in Japan, a place where, under the cover of darkness, there were constant battles between secret organizations and superpowered reincarnators. In the midst of that, a completely ordinary young man awakened to his hidden powers and began to spectacularly mow down his enemies one after another. By the time I'd finished reading the novel, the sun was rising. As a result, I ended up sleeping through basically all of my classes. Even so, once a lazy sixth period and a short homeroom were past, I decided to head for the clubroom. ÅgHey! Wait, wait!Åh As I entered the special building, I heard a voice call to me and turned around. Yuigahama was chasing after me; a flimsy-looking schoolbag banged against one shoulder with every step. 207 5-3 ÅgHikki, you donÅft look so well. WhatÅfs wrong?Åh ÅgAh, well, I mean, spending so much time reading that thing would make anyone tiredÅc IÅfm seriously sleepy. Actually, how can you look completely fine after reading that?Åh ÅgEh?Åh Yuigahama blinked a few times. ÅgÅcAhÅc y-youÅfre right. IÅfm sooooo sleepy right nowÅcÅh ÅgYou definitely didnÅft read it, did youÅc?Åh Yuigahama gazed out the window and hummed, ignoring my question. She was feigning innocence, but I could see cold sweat start to drip down her cheeks and neck. Would it show through her blouseÅc? 208 5-4 5-4 I opened the clubroom door and was greeted by the rare sight of Yukinoshita nodding off. ÅgGood work last night.Åh Even after I called out to her, Yukinoshita's gentle, even breathing continued; she was still asleep. Her almost-smiling face was a far cry from her usual stern, sharp demeanor, and that change made my pulse quicken. I almost felt as if I could just stay and watch her sleep forever. Her black hair, gently waving back and forth; her smooth, almost transparently white skin; her huge teary eyes; her well-formed pink lipsÅc Her lips lightly moved. ÅgÅcIÅfm surprised. One look at your face woke me right up.Åh UwahÅc I think I just woke up too. She deceived me with her pretty appearance, so I almost lost control. I really would love to just make that girl sleepÅc forever. Yukinoshita let out a kitty-like yawn and stretched grandly, extending both her hands above her head. 209 5-4 ÅgFrom the looks of it, you also had a pretty hard fight last night, didnÅft you?Åh ÅgYes, itÅfs been quite a while since IÅfve worked all nightÅc After all, IÅfve never read anything quite like this. I donÅft think I can bring myself to like this sort of thing very much.Åh ÅgYeah. It was also pretty bad for me.Åh ÅgYou didnÅft read it at all. Go and read it now, dammit.Åh At my words, Yuigahama let out a grumpy groan and took out the manuscript in question from her bag. There wasnÅft a single crease in her copy; it was in perfect condition. Then Yuigahama began to flip through the manuscript at an insane pace. She really looked bored out of her mind when she was reading itÅc I watched Yuigahama as she read and began to speak. ÅgItÅfs not like all light novels are like that. There are definitely a decent number of good ones.Åh I was fully aware that that statement really did Zaimokuza no favors. Yukinoshita cocked her head to the side and spoke to me. 210 5-4 ÅgLike the one youÅfve been reading around the clubroom lately?Åh ÅgYeah, that one was good. I recommend you try Gaga-Åg ÅgMaybe if I have time.Åh It seemed that the Ågpeople who say that will never read itÅh rule was in full effect hereÅc I heard a gruff knock on the clubroom door. ÅgThis one begs your pardonÅcÅh Zaimokuza once again spoke in an archaic fashion and entered into the room. ÅgWell then, letÅfs hear your impressions.Åh Zaimokuza docked himself into a chair and crossed his arms arrogantly. There was a sense of superiority coming from God-knows-where on his face. It was an expression overflowing with confidence. However, Yukinoshita, sitting across from him, looked unusually apologetic. ÅgIÅfm sorry. I donÅft really understand these kinds of things too well, butÅcÅh 211 5-4 Yukinoshita started off with that, but Zaimokuza responded completely calmly. ÅgI donÅft mind. Even ones such as I occasionally wish to hear the opinions of the common folk. Speak your mind.Åh ÅgI see.Åh Yukinoshita responded shortly and took a deep breath, steeling her resolve. ÅgIt was boring. In fact, it was almost painful to read. It was boring beyond imagination.Åh ÅgOofgh!Åh Zaimokuza was cut down in a single strokeÅc His chair rattled as he rocked backwards in it, but Zaimokuza managed to find his balance and sit upright again. ÅgH-hmmÅc Well then, for future reference, would you kindly inform me: which parts of the work were boring?Åh ÅgFirst off, the grammar was a mess. Why did you reverse the word order of sentences so much? DonÅft you know how to use particles? DidnÅft they teach you that in elementary school?Åh 212 5-4 ÅgNghhhÅc I believed that style would be better at engaging the readers with the workÅcÅh ÅgShouldnÅft you only think about things like that once youÅfve managed to write past the bare minimum standard of proper Japanese? Additionally, you abuse furigana1 far too often. Here you write ÅenouryokuÅf but have the furigana ÅechikaraÅf2 above itÅc No one pronounces it that way. Furthermore, you wrote ÅeGenkou HasenÅf here, which is more-or-less ÅePhantom Crimson Slash,Åf but you wrote above it ÅeBloody Nightmare Slasher.Åf Where exactly did the ÅenightmareÅf come from?Åh ÅgUfghh! O-OooÅc YouÅfre wrong! All the supernatural battle novels lately have used lots of furiganaÅcÅh ÅgThat's strictly for your own self-satisfaction. It isn't going to reach anyone else. Do you really want others to read this? If you really do, then you also have to make it less predictable. I could tell what was coming in the story from miles away and there was no sign that things would get more interesting. And why is the heroine stripping here? ThereÅfs absolutely no lead-up to it.Åh ÅgHnghhh! B-but novels that donÅft have that kind of thing in them donÅft sellÅc so you have toÅc That isÅcÅh 1 Furigana: In Japanese writing, sometimes a kanji is used but is meant to be pronounced in a different way, which is indicated by small furigana above it. For example, you could write down the kanji for nightmare, à´ñ≤, which is pronounced Ågakumu,Åh but above it in small print you write ÅgÉiÉCÉgÉÅÉA,Åh or Ågnaitomea,Åh which is a clear reference to the English pronunciation. This is often used to force more ÅgWesternÅh pronunciations of certain things, especially proper nouns, but overuse of this technique can often make a work rather childish and heavy-handed. 2 Nouryoku means ÅgabilityÅh while chikara means more something like Ågpower.Åh 213 5-4 ÅgAlso, the narration is too long and has so many convoluted kanji, so itÅfs just really hard to read. Also, please refrain from trying to make people read an unfinished story. Before we even talk about literary style, maybe you should go and get some common sense.Åh ÅgPnnghyahhh!!Åh Zaimokuza stretched out his limbs and let out a shriek. His shoulders convulsed, and he looked up at the ceiling with blank eyes. His little overreaction was getting a bit annoying, so he really should stop that soonÅc ÅgLetÅfs stop there for now. ItÅfd probably be bad if you went through everything in a single sitting.Åh ÅgI still have a lot more to say, thoughÅc Well then, fine. I suppose Yuigahama-san is next.Åh ÅgEh?! M-me?!Åh Yuigahama seemed shocked, and Zaimokuza faced her with a pleading expression. His eyes were tearing up. Yuigahama probably saw that and pitied the poor fellow, so she seemed to try and think of some compliment she could pay him. She fell into thought while staring off into the air and summoned up a few words of encouragement. 214 5-4 ÅgU-ummÅc Y-you sure do know a lot of tough wordsÅcÅh) ÅgUwaaagghhhh!!Åh ÅgYou finished him offÅcÅh To aspiring novelists, that phrase was an absolute taboo. After all, think about itÅc It meant that it was the only good thing Yuigahama could say about ZaimokuzaÅfs novel. It was a common phrase to hear when someone writing a light novel asked people not used to light novels for their opinions. And it was absolutely equivalent to being told that your work was not interesting at all. ÅgW-well thenÅc Hikki, go ahead.Åh Yuigahama almost seemed to be running away when she stood up and offered me her seat. I sat right in front of Zaimokuza and Yuigahama took another seat diagonally behind me. It seemed that she no longer could handle looking Zaimokuza straight in the eyes when he was in this completely burned-out, pale state. ÅgG-gnnghhÅc H-Hachiman. You understand me, right? The world I created, this vast landscape of light novel magnificenceÅc You understand it, right? You understand this profound story I spun and all these other fools cannot hope to appreciateÅc Right?Åh 215 5-4 YeahÅc I understood him all too well. I nodded reassuringly. Zaimokuza looked at me with eyes of absolute trust. I guess that as a man, I had to answer truthfully here. I took one deep breath and spoke kindly: ÅgSo, just who did you rip-off to write that?Åh ÅgHnghh?! B-bbngghÅc GurgleÅcÅh Zaimokuza writhed back and forth on the floor, but stopped once he crashed right into the wall. Then he just lay there, not moving a muscle. His empty eyes stared up at the ceiling, and a single tear streaked down his cheek. It was the look of a man who was ready to die.) ÅgÅcYouÅfre the one with no mercy. That was definitely much more cruel than mine.Åh Yukinoshita was completely taken aback. ÅgÅcHey, youÅcÅh 216 5-4 Yuigahama was poking me with her elbowÅc It seemed that she wanted me to follow up with something. But what exactly should I say hereÅc? When I thought about it, though, I realized that I had forgotten to mention one of the most fundamental things when it came to light novels: ÅgWell, the important thing is the illustrations. So donÅft worry so much about the writing.Åh 217 5-4 218 5-5 5-5 Zaimokuza did a few breathing exercises to calm himself down, as if he was in a Lamaze class, and then stood up on a newborn deer's shaky limbs. Then he dusted himself off with his hands and looked directly at me. ÅgÅcWould youÅc read my work again?Åh I couldnÅft believe my ears. I fell into silence, unable to understand what he was saying, but he repeated himselfÅc This time with a clearer, stronger voice. ÅgWould you read my work again?Åh He faced me and Yukinoshita with fire in his eyes. ÅgYouÅcÅh ÅgAre you a complete masochist?Åh Yuigahama, who was hiding in my shadow, gave Zaimokuza a look of disgust. Her eyes seemed to say, ÅhYou pervert, go die.Åh No, YuigahamaÅc That wasn't it. 219 5-5 ÅgDo you really want to do that again after everything you went through today?Åh ÅgOf course. That certainly was quite harsh criticism. That certainly did make me think that I wanted to die, that IÅfm unpopular and have no friends anywayÅc Or, rather, that made me want everyone else to die.Åh ÅgYeah, I can see thatÅc If someone said all that to me, IÅfd want to die too.Åh But Zaimokuza had taken those words head-on, and was still here talking to us. ÅgHoweverÅc However, those words still made me happy. To have something I wrote for fun read by someone else, critiqued by someone elseÅc That is definitely not a bad thing. ItÅfs not clear to me what I should call these feelings right now, thoughÅc But having my work read definitely makes me happy.Åh Having said that, Zaimokuza smiled. It wasnÅft the smile of the master fencer generalÅc It was the smile of Zaimokuza Yoshiteru. AhhÅc I see. This guy wasnÅft just a chuunibyou. No, he also suffered from a bad case of Writer Fever. 220 5-5 He wanted to write because he had something he wanted to tell others. And if he could touch someone's heart that way, then he was happy. So he would write and write and write, over and over again. Even if nobody acknowledged what he wrote, he would continue writing. That was what I called Writer Fever. And so there was only one way I could respond: ÅgSure, IÅfll read it.Åh I couldn't possibly refuse. After all, this was ZaimokuzaÅfs final state of mind after he had truly come to terms with his chuunibyou. Even if others said he was sick, even if others frowned on him, even if others ignored him or ridiculed him, he would never bend to their wills, he would never give up, and he would continue to work desperately to bring his delusions into reality. ÅgWhen I finish a new novel, IÅfll bring it here.Åh Zaimokuza said those words, turned his back to us, and strode grandly from the room. The sight of the door closing behind him was unpleasantly dazzling. Even if he was warped, childish, or wrong, if he could force his ideas through, then that was exactly what he should do. 221 5-5 If he was willing to change just because someone rejected his ideas, than his dreams were not worthwhile and he was lying to himself. So Zaimokuza was fine like this. ÅcWell, except for those gross parts of his personality, anyway. 222 5-6 5-6 A few days had passed. It was sixth period. The last class of the day was gym. Just as always, I had been paired with Zaimokuza. Nothing there had changed. ÅgHachiman. Who do you think is the most popular, most amazing illustrator out there right now?Åh ÅgDonÅft get ahead of yourself--you can think about that after you win the prize.Åh ÅgHmÅc Fair enough. The bigger issue is where I should make my debutÅcÅh ÅgSeriously, why are you assuming that youÅfre going to win?Åh ÅgÅcIf it sells well, then maybe they can turn it into an anime and I can marry a seiyuuÅcÅh1 ÅgThatÅfs enoughÅc Just stop it. Write the damn manuscript first, okay?Åh 1 Japanese word for Ågvoice actor.Åh ItÅfs one of my rules to never translate this word, just because it has such a different nuance when put into EnglishÅc 223 5-6 My gym class conversations with Zaimokusa began to go more or less like that. That was the only thing that had changed. Well, that said, the contents of those conversations were pretty pointlessÅc ItÅfs not like we were talking about particularly happy things, so unlike the other pairs, we never burst into laughter. The stuff we talked about wasnÅft cool or trendy; it was just filled with pathetic things. I really thought that we were idiots for doing that. I really felt that there was absolutely no point in it. Even soÅc At the very least, gym was no longer an unpleasant time. But that was all. 224 225 226 6-1 Chapter 6: However, Totsuka Saika is coming along. Komachi, my little sister, had a piece of toast in one hand and was completely absorbed in a fashion magazine. I watched her out of the corner of my eye as I drank my morning cup of black coffee. Annoying phrases like Åghow to get a manÅh and Ågsuper trendyÅh appeared repeatedly; in general, the article seemed to be filled to the very brim with idiocy. I found my mouth had opened blankly, dribbling coffee out of the corner of my lips. Will Japan really be okay like this? That article was seriously lowest common denominator, and yet my little sister was nodding as she read it. What the hell was there to agree with? That ÅgHeaventeenÅh magazine or whatever seemed to be the biggest fashion magazine for middle school girls. It was at the point where people didnÅft just read it--it was more that if you didnÅft read it, you would get bullied at school. ÅgOhhhÅcÅh Komachi sounded impressed by something. Bread crumbs rained on the magazine page. Was she trying to be a one-person Hansel and Gretel or something? It was seven forty-five AM. 227 6-1 ÅgHey, the time.Åh My little sister was still engrossed in her magazine, so I poked her shoulder with my elbow, trying to tell her that it was time for her to go to school. Once I did that, Komachi suddenly raised her head to check the clock. ÅgUwahh, oh no!Åh Komachi shouted that, then immediately shut her magazine and stood right up. ÅgWait wait wait wait, you--look at your mouth. You still got something there.Åh ÅgEh, really? My mouth is all jammed up?Åh ÅgYour mouth some sort of automatic rifle now? ThatÅfs definitely not the right way to use Åejammed up.ÅfÅh1 ÅgOh no, oh no.Åh She continued rushing around and wiped her mouth with her pajama sleeve. You know, my little sister can be pretty masculine sometimesÅc 1 I just want to mention that after translating so many volumes of light novels, this is probably the very first pun IÅfve encountered that I could translate almost verbatim into English. Bring out the champagne. 228 6-1 ÅgBy the way, oniichan,2 sometimes you just donÅft know what youÅfre saying, do you?Åh ÅgYouÅfre the one who doesnÅft know! You are!Åh But my panicked little sister didnÅft seem to even hear what I was saying and began to change into her uniform. She took off her pajamas, showing her smooth, white skin, her white sports bra, and her white panties. DonÅft strip right here, dammitÅc Little sisters are strange entities: no matter how cute they are, you never feel anything at all. To me, her underwear was simply a piece of cloth. She certainly was cute, but in the end, all I could think was that she really did resemble meÅc That's how it is with real little sisters. Komachi, now dressed in her unfashionable school uniform, gave me a view of her panties through her knee-height skirt as she pulled on her socks and folded them at her shins. I watched her from the corner of my eye as I reached out for the sugar and milk. Was she trying to grow bigger breasts or something? Komachi had been drinking lots of milk latelyÅc Whatever. I didnÅft care at all. 2 Fairly standard, somewhat affectionate honorific for older brothers. 229 6-1 But putting Ågthe milk my little sister drankÅh in quote marks like that made it sound a bit immoral and eroticÅc Whatever. I donÅft care at all. ItÅfs not like I grabbed the sugar and milk because the milk was Ågthe milk my little sister drank.Åh I just wanted to add them to my coffee. As someone born and bred in Chiba, someone who took his first bath in MAX Coffee, someone who was raised on MAX Coffee3 instead of breast milk, I had to have sugar when I drank coffee. Condensed milk was even better. But I could drink coffee black too if I had to. ÅgLife is too bitter, so coffee, at least, should be sweetÅcÅh I mumbled something that was honestly worthy of a MAX Coffee commercial as I finished drinking my now-sweetened coffee. That was goodÅc That line. They really should use it. ÅgOniichan! IÅfm ready!Åh ÅgBut your oniichan is still drinking his coffeeÅcÅh 3 A sweetened coffee drink. Actually, one of the only places in Japan these things are sold is in Chiba, so this makes sense. 230 6-1 I responded with a poor impression of something from a rerun of ÅgKita no Kuni karaÅh4 , but Komachi didnÅft seem to notice and just started singing happily. ÅgGonna be laaate~~. Gonna be laaate~~.Åh Did she actually want to be late or was she saying we shouldnÅft be lateÅc? I couldnÅft tell.)= A few months ago, this idiot sister of mine completely overslept. Just when it seemed that she would definitely be late, I put her on the back of my bike and gave her a ride to school. Ever since then, little by little, the frequency with which I took her to school had been steadily rising. There is nothing less trustworthy than a girlÅfs tears. That was especially true with Komachi, who apparently was well-equipped with the skills often possessed by the younger siblings. She could masterfully manipulate her older brother. What a nasty girlÅc She was responsible for my belief that all girls are like her, always using boys for their own selfish gains. ÅgItÅfs your fault if I stop trusting women, you know. What am I going to do if I grow old without getting married?Åh ÅgIf that happens, then Komachi will do something about it.Åh 4 Japanese TV drama. 231 6-1 Komachi gave me a smile. I thought my little sister would always remain a child, but seeing that strangely mature look on her face made my heart beat a bit faster. ÅgIÅfll work hard to save money and put you in a nursing home.Åh Maybe she was matureÅc Or maybe she was just trying to sound like an adult. ÅgÅcI guess you really are my little sister, huhÅc?Åh I couldnÅft stop myself from letting out a sigh. I drained the last of my coffee and stood up. When I did that, Komachi began to push me from behind. ÅgOniichan is being slow, so itÅfs already this late! Komachi is going to be laaate~~!Åh ÅgYou damn bratÅcÅh If she wasnÅft my little sister, then I would've already sent her flying. Things were flipped in the Hikigaya household. My dad was unusually doting when it came to my little sister; he's been known to say that he would kill any boy who came close to my sister, even if that boy was her older brother. Hearing him say that seriously nauseated me. But in the end, if I sent my little sister flying, then I probably would be kicked out of the family. 232 6-1 So in short, not only was I the lowest rung the school social ladder, I was even the lowest rung in my own family. We left the house and I mounted my bike. Komachi got on behind me, wrapping her arms around my waist to hold me tight. ÅgLetÅfs go!Åh ÅgHasnÅft anybody taught you how to say Åethank youÅf?Åh Riding double on a bicycle is forbidden by the Road Traffic Law, but Komachi has the mind of a child, so please go easy on usÅc I lightly set off. Soon Komachi spoke up. ÅgDonÅft crash today, okay? Komachi is riding with you this time.Åh ÅgSo itÅfs okay for me to crash if IÅfm by myselfÅc?Åh ÅgNo no no. Oniichan, sometimes you get this glassy dead-fish look in your eyesÅc I worry about you. This is what they call a little sisterÅfs love, you know?Åh 233 6-1 Komachi said that and pressed her face into my back. If she had left out that first part then I would have been tempted to call her cute, but now she just seemed like a sly brat. But to be honestÅc I didnÅft want to cause my family any pointless anxiety either. ÅgÅc Yeah, IÅfll be careful.Åh ÅgMake sure youÅfre especially careful when Komachi is on board. Seriously.Åh ÅgYouÅfre begging me to pick the bumpiest way to school, right?Åh But, naturally, I didnÅft want a repeat of the last time I did that. All I got was ÅgOw, that hurts!Åh ÅgThat hit my butt!Åh and ÅgNow IÅfll never be able to get married!Åh the entire way, so I chose a pretty level path. All her outbursts that one time gave me a bad reputation in the neighborhood, you knowÅc In any case, safety first. I had gotten into a traffic accident on my first day of school. I was pretty nervous about starting a new life at my new school, but I sealed my fate when I chose to leave an hour early for the school entrance ceremony. 234 6-1 I think it was around seven in the morningÅc A girl walking her dog near the school lost her grip on the leash when, unfortunately, an expensive-looking limousine was coming down the road. Before I knew it, I had began to hurtle towards them at full speed. And so they had to call an ambulance to take me to the hospital. That was the moment that destined me to be alone through high school. That accident wrecked my sparkling brand-new bike, and I got a hairline fracture in my golden left foot.5 If I were a soccer player, then a dark shadow would have been cast over the Japanese soccer world that day. Thank God I wasnÅft. And it was a relief that my injuries werenÅft that severe. What wasn't a relief was the fact that the only people who came to visit me in the hospital were family. My family came to visit me once every three days. Dammit, at least visit me every dayÅc 5 A term often used to refer to soccer players who are especially proficient with their left foot. 235 6-1 After my accident, my sister and parents began to eat out a lot. Every time my sister came and talked about how they had gone to eat sushi or Korean barbeque, I wanted to just reach out and snap her pinky. ÅgBut it was pretty nice how fast you healed. That plaster cast must have really helped, IÅfm sure. Plaster is the best way to heal bruises, after all!Åh ÅgYou idiot, youÅfre mixing up plaster and ointment, arenÅft you?6 Also, I had a fracture, not a bruise.Åh ÅgOniichan is going off and saying weird things again.Åh ÅgUgh! YouÅfre the one who doesnÅft understand!Åh But Komachi didnÅft seem to be listening to me; she changed the topic as if it was the most natural thing in the world. ÅgJa know, oniichanÅcÅh ÅgHm? ÅeJa knowÅf? Is that an Issei Fuu** Sepia7 reference? YouÅfre reaaally dating yourself there.Åh 6 Plaster (the kind used in casts) and ointment are very similar in Japanese. ItÅfs ÅgsekkouÅh versus Ågnankou.Åh 7 Reference to Issei Fuubi Sepia, a musical group active in the 1980s. Komachi says Ågsoiya,Åh which is a weird way of saying Ågsouieba,Åh which apparently is something this group is known for saying. 236 6-1 ÅgYou know, oniichanÅc There must be something wrong with your ears.Åh ÅgYouÅfre the one who canÅft speak properlyÅcÅh ÅgYou know, after that accent, that dogÅfs owner came to thank us.Åh ÅgI never heard about thisÅcÅh ÅgOniichan was sleeping then. Also, she gave us some candy. It was pretty good.Åh ÅgHey, I definitely donÅft remember eating those sweets. Why did you eat all of them and not tell me?Åh I said that, and as I looked behind me, I saw that Komachi was giving me a shy ÅgteheheÅh kind of smile. This brat was seriously annoyingÅc ÅgBut you knowÅc She went to the same school, so havenÅft you seen her around? She said she would thank you there.Åh I reflexively slammed on the breaks. ÅgAuu!Åh I heard a scream from behind me, and then KomachiÅfs face dug itself into my back. ÅgWhat just happened?Åh 237 6-1 ÅgÅcYouÅc Why didnÅft you tell me that earlier? Did you ask her what her name was or anything?Åh ÅgEh? ÅcShe was the Åecandy person,Åf rightÅc?Åh ÅgIs it the Bon Festival or something? DonÅft say it like the Åeham personÅf8 . So, what was her name?Åh ÅgHmm, I forgetÅc Ahh, we got to my school. Komachi is going ahead!Åh As soon as she said that, Komachi hopped off the bike and dashed off towards the school gate. ÅgYou damn bratÅcÅh I glared at my little sisterÅfs retreating back, but right before she disappeared into the school building, Komachi turned around to give me a quick bow. ÅgIÅfm off, oniichan! Thank you for the ride!Åh 8 This is a reference to a brand of ham sold by the Marudai food company that was marketed as a good type of ham to give as a gift during holiday times. The Ågham personÅh or Ågham manÅh (I didnÅft use the latter here because Komachi is referring to a girl) is a reference to Bessho Tetsuya, an actor who was in so many commercials for these ham products that he picked up ÅgHam manÅh as a nickname (You can see an example here). This is a bit of an unfortunate spot of translation catch 22, since Ågcandy manÅh is actually a recognizable phrase in English, while Ågham manÅh is not, but it is the reverse in Japanese. 238 6-1 When I heard that and saw her waving at me with a smile, even I felt that my little sister was a bit cute. I waved back, but then I heard my little sister add, ÅgAnd be sure to watch out for cars!Åh I let out a resigned sigh and swiveled my bike around, beginning to head for my high schoolÅc Åctowards the high school where that dogÅfs owner might be. ItÅfs not like I had some master plan of what I'd do once I met her. I just was a little curious. But we hadnÅft met for a year after that incident, so that made me think that she didnÅft really care about meeting meÅc Well, that was natural. All I'd done was break my bones to save her dog. It was totally enough for her to just send a thank-you gift to my house. My gaze suddenly fell on the basket attached to the front of my bike, where I saw a black schoolbag that wasn't mine. ÅgÅc That idiot.Åh The minute I turned my bike around and to rush in the opposite direction, I spotted Komachi running towards me with tears in her eyes. 239 6-2 6-2 Different months meant different activities in gym class. In my school, gym was held jointly with three different classes, and the sixty boys in that group were split into two activities. We had the choice between volleyball and track until this month. Now we would be doing tennis or soccer. Naturally, both Zaimokuza and I were brilliant soccer players1 , but we both placed more emphasis on individual skills. Therefore, we concluded that it would actually be counterproductive for us to join the soccer team, so we chose tennis instead. And, naturallyÅc I was a man who had abandoned soccer forever because of the old wounds on my left foot. Not that I ever played soccer to begin withÅc However, it seemed that too many people wanted to play tennis this year. And so, after a heroic round of rock paper scissors, I found myself surviving in the tennis group even as Zaimokuza was thrown back to the soccer group. ÅgHmph, HachimanÅc It is truly regrettable that I will be unable to put my magical curveball on display here. Without youÅc Who in the world should I partner up with for passing practiceÅc?Åh 1 He uses the phrase Ågfantasista,Åh which is Italian in origin but way too obscure in English for me to leave raw in the text. 240 6-2 That made quite a deep impression on me: Zaimokuza had gone from his usual confident demeanor to teary-eyed desperation. Who in the world would be your partner? That applied to me, too. And so tennis class began. I did some half-assed stretching and then listened to a tennis lecture from our gym teacher, Atsugi. ÅgOkay, everyone try hitting now. Pair up, one on each side of the net.Åh Once Atsugi had said that, everyone split up into small groups and went to opposite sides of the court. How the hell did they pair up so fast? They didnÅft even look around! Were they masters of the no-look pass2 or something? My sensitive loner radar began to act up, detecting an elevated chance of a loner opportunity. Fear not: I had developed a special trick for times like these. 2 Reference to soccer when a player passes a ball to another player without looking. 241 6-2 ÅgUmm, IÅfm not feeling so well right now, so can I go just play by myself off the wall? I donÅft want to cause anybody else any trouble.Åh I announced that and, without waiting for AtsugiÅfs response, I quickly walked towards the wall and began hitting off it. Atsugi probably saw that he had missed the best timing to respond to me, so he didnÅft argue with me at all. That was way too perfectÅc The statements Ågnot feeling so wellÅh and Ågcause anybody else troubleÅh had a great synergistic effect, and using them also allowed me to nonchalantly act as if I actually did have the motivation to work hard. This was it: the master countermeasure that I had discovered after so many gym classes where I was told to Ågpair up with whomever you like.Åh Maybe I should teach Zaimokuza some dayÅc IÅfm sure that guy would break out into tears of joy. I chased after the ball and hit it back at the wall, repeating that motion over and over again. Time trickled by as I continued with that humdrum activity. I heard boisterous shouts from around me as the other boys engaged in flashy tennis rallies. ÅgUryahhh! Ohh?! That was a good shot, wasnÅft it?! That was amazing, wasnÅft it?!Åh 242 6-2 ÅgThat was great! No way anybody else couldÅfve hit that! Awesome!Åh Their shouting suggested that they were definitely having fun during their free practice session. ÅhShut up and dieÅcÅh I thought as I turned around, when I saw Hayama. HayamaÅfs pair--or, rather, he seemed to be in a group of four--consisted of himself, a blonde that IÅfd seen hanging out with him a lot in class, and two others that I didnÅft really recognize. They were probably from class C or class I or somethingÅc At any rate, they were practically exuding an aura of flashy stylishness as they played. ÅgWoahh!Åh The blonde missed the return on a ball that Hayama hit and shouted. Everyone turned towards them, wondering what had happened. ÅgHayama-kun, that was seriously something else! Did that ball curve? It curved, didnÅft it?!Åh ÅgAhh, I guess I accidentally sliced the ballÅc Sorry, that was my bad.Åh Hayama raised a hand in apology, but his words were drowned out by the blondeÅfs next overreaction. 243 6-2 ÅgSeriously?! You can hit curve balls and stuff like that?! Hayama is the real deal, man! The real deal!Åh ÅgHaha, really?Åh Hayama decided to join in, laughing happily. At that point, the pair hitting next to Hayama and company also spoke up. ÅgHayama-kun is good at tennis too, isnÅft he? That slice you just did right nowÅc Could you teach me how to do that too?Åh The guy who said that and started to walk towards Hayama was a boy with dyed brown hair who otherwise looked pretty meek. We were probably in the same class. I didnÅft know his name, so he probably was no big deal. In the blink of an eye, HayamaÅfs quartet had grown into a sextet. They were now the largest ruling body of this gym classÅc By the way, ÅgsextetÅh sounds a lot like Ågsexaroid,Åh3 doesnÅft it? Yup, yup, so naughtyÅc In any case, that was how tennis class became the Hayama Kingdom. It almost felt as if you shouldnÅft be in the class if you werenÅft part of their group. Naturally, everyone outside of the Hayama group was silent. Farewell, freedom of speechÅc 3 Not in English, Hachiman. Not in English. Also, for those of you who donÅft know what a sexaroid isÅc itÅfs exactly what it sounds like. 244 6-2 The noisiness of the Hayama group gave off a strong impression, but Hayama himself wasnÅft making much of that noise--it was more the people around him. More specifically, that blonde guy, who had volunteered to be the Chief of Staff of the Hayama Kingdom, was the noisiest. ÅgSlice!Åh See? HeÅfs insanely noisy. The ball the blonde guy hit wasnÅft a slice at all, and it instead flew completely off course from Hayama into the damp, dark corner of the court. In other words, it flew towards me. ÅgAh, sorry, my bad! U-UmmÅc HiÅc? Hikitani-kun? Hikitani-kun, could you get that ball?Åh Who the hell was Hikitani? But I didn't feel like correcting him, so I just grabbed the ball that was rolling towards me and threw it back. ÅgThanks!Åh Hayama gave me a cheerful smile and waved at me. 245 6-2 In response, I gave him a small nod. ÅcWhy the hell did I nod back? It seemed that I had instinctively come to think of Hayama as above meÅc Even by my standards, that was really submissive. It was so submissive that it made me think that even in terms of submissiveness I was probably losing to someoneÅc I took these gloomy feelings of mine and hit them against the wall. Walls were essential companions in youth. ÅcOn that note, I wonder why Ågplaster wallÅh is slang for Ågsmall breastsÅh? By one theory, plaster walls are just tanuki spirits4 , and the wall itself is the tanuki spirit spreading its genitals. What kind of wall was that supposed to be? That actually sounded surprisingly softÅc And so, in other words, quite paradoxically, when you ridiculed a girl with small breasts by calling her a plaster wall, werenÅft you saying that her breasts were pretty soft? QED, proof over. Idiots. However, IÅfm sure that Hayama would never come to that conclusion. That miraculous theory was only made possible by my unusual resentment. All right, letÅfs call it a tie for today thenÅc Yup, that sounds about right. 4 Raccoon dog, similar to a fox. Known to be mischievous. 246 6-3 6-3 It was lunch break. I was eating lunch in my usual spot. My home base was on the first floor of the special building, to the side of the nurseÅfs office and diagonally behind the cafeteria. To give you a better idea, it was a position from which I could see right out into the tennis courts. I leisurely ate the hot dog1 , tuna onigiri2 , and Neapolitan roll3 I had bought from the cafeteria. And I was at peace. All the while, a rhythmic drumming sound lured me to sleep. The tennis girls had their independent practice session at noon, so they were outside at the wall; they hit the ball and made heroic efforts to chase it when it returned, and then they hit it again. 1 He says Ågwiener roll,Åh but to me thatÅfs a friggin hot dog. 2 Onigiri is a triangular shaped cake of rice, often with filling (in this case tuna). 3 Apparently it has soba noodles and stuff in it. What in the worldÅc. 247 6-3 I followed their movements with my eyes as I ate my lunch. As the lunch break was about to end, I sucked some lemon tea out of its pack through a straw and felt the wind blow. The windÅfs direction had changed. It varied with the day-to-day weather, but because this school was near the sea, the wind would usually change direction some time around noon. It was almost as if the morning's sea breeze was returning from whence it came. Spending some time alone, just feeling that wind on my skin, wasnÅft a bad thing at all. ÅgHuh? Hikki, is that you?Åh That same wind carried a familiar voice to my ears. When I turned around, I saw Yuigahama standing there, holding down her skirt to protect it from any more gusts of wind. ÅgWhatcha doinÅf over here?Åh ÅgI usually eat here.Åh ÅgHmm, really? Why? WouldnÅft it be better to just eat in the classroom?Åh 248 6-3 ÅgÅcÅh Yuigahama seemed genuinely bewildered, but I just responded to her question with silence. Seriously, if I could do that, do you really think IÅfd be out here eatingÅc? Pay attention, dammit. LetÅfs change the subject. ÅgMore importantly, why are you here?Åh ÅgOh yeah! Truth is, I lost a game of rock paper scissors with Yukinon, soÅc I guess this is my penalty?Åh ÅgTalking to me is a penaltyÅc?Åh That was so sadÅc Made me want to die. ÅgN-no, no! The loser had to go buy juice! ThatÅfs it!Åh Yuigahama hurriedly waved her hands, denying my accusation. What a relief; after that, I was totally ready to kill myselfÅc 249 6-3 Yuigahama smoothed down her chest in relief, then she plopped herself down next to me. ÅgYukinon didnÅft like it at first. ÅeI can provide my own food. What do I stand to gain, aside from winning a trivial competition?Åf That's what she said.Åh For some reason, Yuigahama was trying to imitate Yukinoshita. She completely failed. ÅgWell, that does sound like her.Åh ÅgYeah, but then I said, ÅeSo you donÅft think you can win?Åf Then she agreed to play.Åh ÅgÅc Well, that does sound like her.Åh That girl was usually the very picture of cool, but when it came to competitions, she really hated to lose. She'd instantly gotten on board before as soon as Hiratsuka-sensei challenged her. ÅgAnd then, when Yukinon won, she pumped her fists a bitÅc It was really cute, you knowÅcÅh Yuigahama let out a happy sigh. 250 6-3 ÅgI think this is the first time IÅfve thought this penalty game was fun.Åh ÅgYouÅfve done this game before?Åh When I asked that question, Yuigahama gave me a nod. ÅgYeah, a few times beforeÅcÅh Hearing that allowed me to suddenly remember. Near the end of lunch breaks, there was always an idiotically noisy corner of the room shouting about rock paper scissorsÅc ÅgTch, a nice little exclusive club you all have there.Åh ÅgWhatÅfs up with that lousy reaction? You donÅft like things like that?Åh ÅgOf course not. I hate private parties and inside jokesÅc Ah, but I do like internal strife. Cuz IÅfm not on the inside!Åh ÅgNot only is that a sad reason, but you sound completely petty!Åh Shut up. Leave me aloneÅc 251 6-3 Yuigahama smiled as she held her hair, keeping the wind from blowing it. That expression was different from the one I usually saw when she was with Miura and the others in the classroomÅc Ahh, I see. If I had to guess, I'd say she wasnÅft wearing as much makeup. Her face had become much more natural. She'd probably made that change a while back, but, I mean, itÅfs not like I make a habit of staring at girlsÅf facesÅc Ugh, whatever. But that was proof that she had changed, even if only a little. It might've been because she had less makeup on, butÅc When Yuigahama smiled, her eyes relaxed4 and her youthful face became even more youthful. ÅgBut really, I think Hikki has a lot of these Åeprivate partiesÅf too. When weÅfre in the classroom, you always have those fun-looking chats with Yukinon. I-I always feel I canÅft join in on any of thoseÅcÅh As Yuigahama said that, she hugged her knees and buried her face in them. She was glancing sideways towards me. ÅgYou know, cuz maybe I want to join in on those talks tooÅc I-itÅfs not like I mean that in a weird way, okay?! W-when I say that I mean Yukinon too, okay?! You got that?!Åh 4 The more literal translation here would be Ågdrooped,Åh but that sounds rather ugly in English. 252 6-3 ÅgHave no fearÅc ItÅfs not like IÅfll ever make that sort of misunderstanding when it comes to you.Åh ÅgWhatÅfs that supposed to mean?!Åh Yuigahama lifted up her head, looking pretty pissed. ÅgAh, hold on, hold on, calm down!Åh I restrained her with my hands and spoke up. ÅgWell, Yukinoshita is a different story. She is just a force majeure.Åh ÅgWhat do you mean?Åh ÅgHm? Ahh, Åeforce majeureÅf refers to an entity or situation that is impossible to defy by our human strength alone. Sorry for using big words there.Åh ÅgNo! I know what that means, ugh! You know, you insult me way too much! I took the entrance exam and got into Soubu High just like you, all right?!Åh Yuigahama sent a quick chop right into my throat. The clean hit, right to my AdamÅfs Apple, sent me into a coughing fit. Then Yuigahama stared off into the distance and asked me a question, sounding serious. ÅgÅcHey, speaking of the entrance examÅc Do you remember the first day of school?Åh 253 6-3 ÅgCough cough cough!Åc Huh? Ahh, I mean, not really--I got into a traffic accident that day.Åh ÅgAccidentÅcÅh ÅgYeah. On the first day of school, I was pedaling my bike when some idiotÅfs dog got off its leash. That dog almost got run over by a car, so I protected him with my own bodyÅc Naturally, it was a brilliantly dashing and heroic act.Åh I think that I embellished that story a bit, but itÅfs not like anybody else knew about itÅc And if nobody knew about it, then nobody would say anything. So in situations like this, it was best for me to make myself look better. But when she heard that, YuigahamaÅfs face stiffened. ÅgI-idiot, huhÅc So, Hikki doesnÅft remember that person at all?Åh ÅgI mean, I really couldn't have, since I was in so much pain. Well, clearly I wasnÅft impressed enough to remember, so IÅfm guessing that person was pretty plainlooking.Åh Åg(whisper) Plain-lookingÅc W-well, I guess I didnÅft have makeup on that timeÅc and my hair wasnÅft dyed, and I was wearing some random pajamas or somethingÅc Ah, and the pajamas had little bears on them too, so maybe I did look a bit like an idiotÅcÅh 254 6-3 YuigahamaÅfs voice was so low that I couldnÅft hear her at all--I just saw her lips moving as she muttered something and stared at the floor. Did her tummy hurt or something? ÅgWhatÅfs wrong?Åh ÅgItÅfsÅc nothingÅc Anyways! Hikki doesnÅft remember that girl at all, does he?!Åh ÅgYeah, like I said, I donÅft rememberÅc Wait, huh? Did I mention that they were a girl?Åh ÅgHuh?! Y-yeah, you definitely did! You totally did! In fact, all you said was, Åegirl this, girl that, girl this, girl thatÅf!!Åh ÅgAm I seriously that gross of a personÅc?Åh When I said that, Yuigahama just gave me a loud, hollow-sounding laugh and, with a smile still on her face, turned to look at the tennis courts. In response, I turned and did the same. I guess it was just about time for the girl tennis players to wrap up their practice; they were wiping off their sweat and coming back. ÅgHey! Sai-chaan~~!Åh 255 6-3 Yuigahama waved her hands and called out. It seemed she'd spotted someone she knew. That girl noticed Yuigahama and ran up to us with little steps. ÅgHey. Had practice?Åh ÅgYeah. Our team is really weak right now, so we have to practice through lunchÅc WeÅfve been asking them over and over for permission to use the courts during lunch, and they finally gave us the okay. What are Yuigahama-san and Hikigayakun doing here?Åh ÅgAhh, not muchÅcÅh Yuigahama said that and turned to me, as if to ask for confirmation. Well, I was actually eating lunch, and you were on your way to finish an errand, right? She had the attention span of a bird or somethingÅc ÅgI see.Åh That girl, Sai-chan or whatever, gave us a smile. ÅgSai-chan, you play tennis for class and even practice through lunchÅc That must be really tough.Åh 256 6-3 257 6-3 ÅgYeah, but itÅfs what I want to do, so itÅfs fineÅc Ah, also, Hikigaya-kun, youÅfre pretty good at tennis.Åh To my surprise, she turned the conversation to me, so of course I fell silent. It was the first time that I'd heard that. Also, who the hell was this person? Why did she know my name? ÅgOhhÅc?Åh I wanted to ask her a few things, but before I could, Yuigahama butted in, sounding impressed. ÅgReally?Åh ÅgYeah, his form is really good when he plays.Åh ÅgAhh, youÅfre embarrassing me, ha ha haÅc (whisper) So, who is this person?Åh I said the last bit soft enough to make sure only Yuigahama could hear me, but Yuigahama smashed my efforts to itty bitty pieces. ÅgHwahhh?! YouÅfre in the same class! You even take gym class together! Why donÅft you know?! I canÅft believe you!Åh ÅgYou idiot, of course I know! I just happened to forget! ÅcAnd boys and girls donÅft take gym class together! 258 6-3 I was trying to be so considerate, and she completely ruined my effortsÅc Now everyone in the world would know that I didnÅft know this girlÅfs name. And now sheÅfs probably in a bad moodÅc As I thought that, I glanced in Sai-chanÅfs direction and saw that her eyes were tearing upÅc Crap, this was bad. In dog terms, she looked like a Chihuahua, and in cat terms, she looked like a munchkinÅc That was how cute and sad-looking she was. ÅgA-Ahaha. So I guess you really donÅft remember my nameÅc IÅfm Totsuka Saika. WeÅfre in the same class.Åh ÅgA-ah, sorry about that. We changed classes recently, so itÅfs a bit difficult for meÅc Haha.Åh ÅgWe were in the same class during the first year tooÅc Ehehe, maybe I just donÅft have much of a presenceÅcÅh ÅgNah, thatÅfs not itÅc Oh, I got it! ItÅfs just that I donÅft hang out with the girls in our class very much! You know, I still donÅft know the real name of this girl here!Åh ÅgCut it out and remember!Åh Yuigahama smacked me on the head, but even that caused Totsuka to mutter with a grim look on her face. 259 6-3 ÅgYou sure are good friends with Yuigahama-sanÅcÅh ÅgE-ehh?! W-weÅfre definitely not! If anything, all I want to do is kill this guy! Kill Hikki and then IÅfll die tooÅc That sort of thing!Åh ÅgYeah, thatÅfs it! ÅcAlso, thatÅfs damn scary! YouÅfre damn scary! LoverÅfs suicide?!5 I donÅft want that at all!Åh ÅgHuh?! A-are you a complete idiot?! I didnÅft mean it like that at all!Åh ÅgYou two really are pretty closeÅcÅh Totsuka said that in a sad tone, and this time faced me. ÅgIÅfm male, by the wayÅc do I really look that frail to you?Åh ÅgEh?Åh My thoughts and movements completely halted at that moment. I quickly looked to Yuigahama. ThatÅfs a lie, right? I asked with my eyes. But Yuigahama, seemingly still angry, her cheeks still flushed red, just gave me a few strong nods. 5 Where two people in love kill themselves together. 260 6-3 WaitÅc Seriously? That canÅft be right. That has to be a joke. Totsuka saw my doubtful gaze and turned bright red. Her head lowered, and she stared at me with upturned eyes. TotsukaÅfs hand slowly reached down towards her (his?) shorts. That small movement was already enough to captivate me. ÅgÅcI can show you proof, if you want.Åh I felt something inside of my heart twitch. A little devil Hachiman appeared on my right shoulder. ÅhOhh, thatÅfs great, you should just go ahead and take a look--you might get really lucky, ya know?Åh Well, thatÅfs trueÅc This was a pretty rare chance, after all. ÅhWait just a second!Åh Ahh, and now the angel Hachiman has arrived. ÅhWhile youÅfre at it, how about you ask her to take off her top too?Åh What the hellÅc What kind of crappy angel was this? In the end, I decided to listen to my own common sense. Yes, with these kind of androgynous characters, their entire appeal lay in the fact that their gender was so ambiguous! And so, by reaching this logical conclusion, I was able to calm down and proceed with a cool head. 261 6-3 ÅgIn any caseÅc IÅfm sorry. I really didnÅft know, but I apologize if I caused you any discomfort.Åh When Totsuka heard me say that, he shook off the tears that had been building up in his eyes and gave me a smile. ÅgNah, itÅfs fine.Åh ÅgBut, TotsukaÅc IÅfm surprised you know my name.Åh ÅgEh, ahhÅc Well, Hikigaya-kun stands out a lot in class.Åh After Totsuka said that, Yuigahama stared at me. ÅgReeaaally? But heÅfs so plain-lookingÅc ItÅfd take quite a lot to notice a guy like him.Åh ÅgYou idiot, of course I stand out! I stand out like a bunch of glittering stars in the night sky!Åh6 ÅgHow exactly?Åh 6 This is a rather bad misuse of this idiom, which generally is used to refer to only a group of people. 262 6-3 Wow, she said that back to me without batting an eyelash. ÅgÅcW-well, when someone sits in the corner of the classroom and talks to himself, doesnÅft that make him stand out a bitÅc?Åh ÅgAh, thatÅfs what stands-Åc Ahh, ummÅc My condolencesÅcÅh Yuigahama looked away from me. That was exactly the type of attitude that made me gloomy, thoughÅc The atmosphere was getting heavier again, so Totsuka decided to try and save it. ÅgBut seriously, Hikigaya-kun is pretty good at tennis. Have you played before?Åh ÅgI mean, I played a bit of Mario Tennis during elementary school, but I havenÅft played real tennis.Åh ÅgOh, thatÅfs the one everyone plays together. I played that too, you know. Playing doubles was reaaally fun, wasnÅft it~~?Åh ÅgÅcIÅfve only played it by myself.Åh ÅgEh? ÅcÅcAh. Umm, sorry.Åh 263 6-3 ÅgWhat the hell, are you a psychological minesweeper or something? Is it your job to dig up every little bit of trauma I have?Åh ÅgHikkiÅfs the one who has way too many bombs!Åh Totsuka, standing to the side, seemed to be having fun watching the exchange between me and Yuigahama. And like that, the bell that announced the end of lunch break rang. ÅgLetÅfs head back.Åh Totsuka said that, and Yuigahama followed after him. I watched them from behind and suddenly felt a bit strange. I seeÅc They were in the same class, so it was natural for them to leave togetherÅc For some reason I felt moved by that. ÅgHikki? What are you doing?Åh Yuigahama turned back towards me, seeming puzzled. Totsuka also stopped walking and faced me. 264 6-3 I could go together with them? I was about to ask, but I stopped. Instead, I said the following: ÅgWhat happened to that juice you were supposed to buy?Åh ÅgHuh? Åc Ahhh!!Åh 265 6-4 6-4 A few days later, I was in gym class again. Because of my repeated practice sessions with the wall, I had become a master of tennis wall hitting. At this point, I could hold up a rally with the wall without having to move a step in any direction. After tomorrowÅfs class, we would be starting tennis matches for a bit. In other words, today was the last time I would be able to just practice rallying. It was my last rally practice, so I thought I would use it to its fullest, but then I felt something poking me on the right shoulder. And who might this fairy behind my back be? There wasnÅft anyone who would talk to me, so this had to be some kind of supernatural phenomenon, right? I turned around, when I felt a finger poke into my right cheek. ÅgAhah, caught you~.Åh It was Totsuka Saika, giving me a cute smile. 266 6-4 Oof, what was this I was feelingÅc? My heart was seriously pounding. If he wasnÅft a guy, I would have asked him out and then gotten rejected on the spot. Wow, so I guess I would get rejected here? I mean, once you saw Totsuka in his uniform it was plain as day that he was a guy, but when he wore his gym uniform, which was the same for guys and girls, his gender really wasnÅft obvious. If his socks were black and went higher than his ankles, you definitely wouldnÅft be able to tell. His arms, legs, and waist were all slender, and his skin was pale white. Well, it was true that he didnÅft have very large breasts, but itÅfs not like Yukinoshita had those either. For some reason, I felt a horrible shiver run up my spin. So having cooled down, I spoke up to Totsuka, who was standing there still smiling at me. ÅgWhat did you want?Åh ÅgAh. Today you know, the guy I usually pair up with isnÅft at school. SoÅc umm, if you want, wanna be my partner?Åh 267 6-4 Stop looking at me with upturned eyes, dammit. You look way too cute like that. Stop blushing, ugh. ÅgAhh, thatÅfs fine. IÅfm by myself right now too.Åh Sorry, wall. I canÅft hang out with you todayÅc After I apologized to the wall and responded to Totsuka, he seemed relieved. ÅgPhew, what a relief!Åh I heard him mutter. Dammit, hearing that made me nervous. He was seriously way too cute. According to Yuigahama, Because of how cute Totsuka was, some of the girls at school had begun calling him Ågthe Prince.Åh I see, considering Totsuka was a pretty boy who had a feminine sense of cuteness, that name fit him to a tee. In addition, the name Ågthe PrinceÅh also made you want to protect him. With that, my free practice with Totsuka began. Totsuka was on the tennis team, so it was no surprise that he was good. He got to the superb serve I had mastered in my wall-hitting sessions, and returned the ball right at me. 268 6-4 After we had repeated those motions over and over, Totsuka even started to strike up a conversation, almost as if he was getting bored. ÅgAs I thought, Hikigaya-kun is pretty good.Åh Because we were pretty far from each other, Totsuka was speaking pretty slowly. ÅgI was super awesome at wall hitting, so that makes me a tennis master.Åh ÅgThatÅfs squash, not tennisÅcÅh As our slow, drawn-out sentences went back and forth, Totsuka and I continued hitting the ball to each other. The others around us missed shots and missed returns, but we continued our long rally. And then, the rally stopped. Totsuka caught the ball in his hands as it bounced towards him. ÅgLetÅfs take a short break.Åh ÅgAlright.Åh 269 6-4 We sat down together. Why the hell was he sitting next to me? WasnÅft that a bit weird? When two guys sat together, wasnÅft it more normal to sit across from each other or diagonal from each other? WasnÅft he too close? WasnÅft he way too close? ÅgHey, I wanted to ask Hikigaya-kun for some adviceÅcÅh Totsuka spoke with a serious look on his face. I see. If he wanted to ask me for advice in secret, then I guess we had to be close like this. ThatÅfs why we were sitting so close, wasnÅft it? ÅgAdvice, huhÅc?Åh ÅgYeah. ItÅfs about our tennis team actuallyÅc weÅfre really not very good, you know? We donÅft have many people either. And if all the third-years graduate by the next tournament, weÅfll be in even worse shape. There are a lot of freshmen who joined but who didnÅft start playing tennis until high school, so theyÅfre not very used to it yetÅc and because weÅfre so weak we canÅft get motivated either. I mean, itÅfs not like people need to compete for spots to play, soÅcÅh ÅgI see.Åh That made perfect sense. Actually, that seemed like a common problem for the smaller, weaker sports teams. 270 6-4 Because your team wasnÅft very good, people didnÅft join. And because there werenÅft many people, nobody competed for a spot on the starting lineup. Even if you took a break or skipped practice, you could play in the tournament, and as long as you were playing matches, you felt involved enough. There were definitely plenty of people who could be fully satisfied by that even if they didnÅft win any matches. Those players were never going to get any better. And then, because they didnÅft, the team had no hope of attracting new players. And thus continued the vicious cycle. ÅgSoÅc if Hikigaya-kun is okay with it, wonÅft he consider joining the tennis team?Åh ÅgÅc Huh?Åh Where did that come fromÅc? Totsuka saw the confusion in my eyes, and he seemed to shrink into himself as he sat there hugging his knees. He glanced at me once in a while with pleading eyes. ÅgHikigaya-kun is good at tennis, and I think he can get better and better. I think he can motivate the others too. AndÅc if itÅfs with Hikigaya-kun, I think I can try harder too. U-UmmÅc I donÅft mean that in a weird way or anything! I-ItÅfs just that I want to get stronger at tennis!Åh 271 6-4 ÅgItÅfs fine for you to be weakÅc IÅfll protect you.Åh ÅgÅc What?Åh ÅgAh, sorry. My bad.Åh Seeing TotsukaÅfs lovable innocence made me say the completely wrong thing there, even though I should be trying to be serious here. But come on, he is way too cute. He was so cute that I almost ended up agreeing to join his club on the spot. I almost raised my hand with the vigor of someone charging into battle to get the last piece of cake in the cafeteria. But no matter how cute Totsuka may be, there were some requests I just could not grant. ÅgÅc Sorry. I donÅft think I can do thatÅcÅh I knew my own personality all too well. I didnÅft see any point in going to club every day, and also didnÅft believe in physical activity every morning. The only people who did that were the old geezers doing tai chi in the park, right? And after all, ÅgI really canÅft go on with this~~~ÅcÅh was pretty much my favorite motto. 272 6-4 Might have sounded I ripped that off from Korosuke,1 the Kiteretsu character, but the point is I would definitely end up quitting the team. Even with my first parttime job, I ended up playing hooky three days in. If someone like me joined the tennis team, I guarantee that all I would do is get Totsuka depressed. ÅgÅc I seeÅcÅh Totsuka seemed disappointed. Meanwhile, I tried to find something to say in this situation. ÅgWell ummÅc donÅft worry. IÅfll try to figure something out.Åh Even though I couldnÅft do anything. ÅgThanks. I think I feel a bit better after talking with Hikigaya-kun.Åh Totsuka smiled at me, but I knew that his peace of mind was only temporary. At the same time, a part of me also thought that even if it was only temporary, if Totsuka felt at peace, that in and of itself was worthwhile. 1 He ends his sentences with Ågnari,Åh which is characteristic of this particular character. 273 6-5 6-5 ÅgImpossible.Åh That was the first thing Yukinoshita said to me. ÅgImpossible, huhÅc But, umm-Åg ÅgThe impossible is impossible.Åh And I was coldly rejected once more. This had started when I took Totsuka's words and went to Yukinoshita for advice. My plan was to steer the conversation so that I could quit the service club and then publically announce my intention to join the tennis team. Then, little by little, I would fade out of that club as wellÅc But now that plan was being cleanly blocked. ÅgI mean, I can see where Totsuka was coming from when he asked me to join the tennis team--in short, I have to scare them into being more active. If a new person joins the club, won't that eventually change things?Åh 274 6-5 ÅgDo you really think you can survive in a group setting like that? Do you think they would readily accept a creature like you?Åh ÅgUguuÅcÅh TrueÅc I wouldn't exactly be praised for just quitting, but if I saw all those people lazing around during club and enjoying themselves, then I might go and start hitting them with my racquet. Yukinoshita's short chuckle almost sounded like a sigh. ÅgYou really donÅft understand what it means to be in a group, do you? YouÅfre a master of solitude.Åh ÅgYouÅfre the last person I want to hear that fromÅcÅh Yukinoshita continued talking, completely ignoring my comeback. ÅgI admit that itÅfs possible that they will band together if presented with a common enemy such as youÅc But they would only make the effort required to throw you out, which will not translate into any personal improvement. Therefore, that isnÅft a solution at all. I stand as evidence of that.Åh ÅgI seeÅc Wait, youÅfre evidence?Åh 275 6-5 ÅgYes. I returned from overseas in middle school, so naturally I started at a new place, but all the girls in my classÅc Or, rather, all the girls in the school were desperate to drive me out. Even so, not a single person tried to better themselves to the point where they could beat me. What imbecilesÅcÅh I couldÅfve sworn that I saw black flames fill the air behind Yukinoshita. Crap, I think I just stepped on a land mine hereÅc ÅgU-uh, yeah, that makes sense, I guessÅc I mean, if a girl's as cute as you, then that sort of thing happensÅcÅh ÅgÅcW-well, thatÅfs true. Compared to the other girls, itÅfs no exaggeration to say that my looks are by far the best, and itÅfs not like the other girls are so weakwilled as to just lay down and give up at that, so you could say it was a natural result. That said, Yamashita-san and Shimamura-san were also pretty cuteÅc They were pretty popular with the boys as well. But that only applied to their looks. When it came to academics, sports, artistic ability, and even etiquette and spirit, they couldnÅft even hope to reach my ankles. And if turning the entire world upside down still won't be enough to beat me, then itÅfs natural that they would concentrate all their efforts into grabbing me by the legs and dragging me down insteadÅcÅh Yukinoshita had seemed at a loss for words for a moment, but she soon fell back into her same old rhythm and started shooting out flowery, self-aggrandizing statements one after the other. 276 6-5 You could say that her speech flowed like a river, but it was more like the torrents of Niagara FallsÅc Saying all that without missing a beat was seriously impressive. Could it be that it was YukinoshitaÅfs way of hiding her embarrassment? So maybe she had her cute sides tooÅc Yukinoshita was catching her breath, probably because she had talked for so long. Her face was also slightly red. ÅgÅcÅcCould you please try not to say something weird? IÅfm just trembling in fear.Åh ÅgAhh, what a reliefÅc As I thought. YouÅfre not cute at all.Åh Actually, to be honest, Totsuka was way cuter than any of the girls I knewÅc What the hell. Oh, rightÅc We were supposed to be talking about Totsuka here. ÅgBut Totsuka should be happy if something can be done to improve the tennis teamÅcÅh As I spoke, Yukinoshita widened her eyes and stared at me. 277 6-5 ÅgHow unusualÅc Since were you the type of person to worry about others?Åh ÅgHey, come onÅc This is the first time someoneÅfs asked me for advice, so, you knowÅcÅh In the end, getting asked for help did make me somewhat happy. Plus, Totsuka was pretty cuteÅc Without realizing it, my lips began to loosen into a smile. Yukinoshita butted in, almost as if she wanted to stop that smile. ÅgIÅfve often been asked for love advice in the past.Åh Her chest puffed out proudly as she spoke, but her expression gradually darkened. ÅgÅcAlthough when a girl asks for love advice, itÅfs usually just a strategy to tie others down.Åh ÅgHuh? What do you mean?Åh ÅgÅfIf I announce who I like, then the people around me will start to be more careful, right? ItÅfs like marking your territory. Once it's a known fact, trespassing will get you treated like a thief and thrown out. Even a guy who confesses will still get thrown out.Åf Did you really need to tell me all thatÅc?Åh 278 6-5 Black flames were burning behind Yukinoshita again. After she said Åggirls and love advice,Åh I'd hoped for something really bittersweet, but that just sounded unpleasant. Why did she have to go and trample on another one of this pure boyÅfs dreams? Was she enjoying this? Yukinoshita suddenly laughed wryly, as if to wash away her unpleasant memories. ÅgIn short, donÅft just assume that itÅfs a good thing to listen to every wish and try to help everyone. IsnÅft it an old saying? ÅeEven lions will throw their cubs into bottomless pits and kill them.ÅfÅh1 ÅgKilling them would defeat the purposeÅcÅh Besides, the real saying is, ÅgEven when hunting their own cubs, lions will exhaust all their strength.Åh2 ÅgSo what would you do, then?Åh ÅgMe?Åh 1 The saying implies that lions train their cubs by putting them through much hardship. Of course, the last part of YukinoshitaÅfs version, Ågkill them,Åh is not in the original saying. 2 After much Internet searching, IÅfve found both of these sayings floating around, along with many claims that one or both of them are actually bastardizations of older sayings dealing with lion cubs. But whatever, I donÅft think the etymology is very important here. 279 6-5 The confused Yukinoshita blinked a few times, then fell into thought. ÅgI suppose I would make them all run until they died, then make them practice racquet swings until they died, and then make them play practice matches until they died.Åh She said all that with a bit of a smile on her face. It was seriously scary. Then I jumped in my seat--the door had just flown open with a bang. ÅgHeyoo~~!!Åh In complete contrast to Yukinoshita, Yuigahama entered with that happy-golucky, screwed-in-the-head greeting. Yuigahama had her usual stupid grin on her face. She seemed as carefree as ever. However, there was someone else behind her with a serious yet feeble-looking expression on his face. His lowered eyes were devoid of confidence, and he was weakly gripping the hem of YuigahamaÅfs blazer. His skin was pale white. He reminded me of a faint dream, something that would disappear the minute you looked at it under the light. 280 6-5 ÅgAhÅc Hikigaya-kun!Åh He gave me a bright smile the moment he saw me, and color seemed to return to his pale skin. When he smiled like that, I finally realized who he was. Why did he look so gloomyÅc? ÅgTotsukaÅcÅh He slowly pitter-pattered towards me, and this time, he grabbed my sleeve tightly. Hey, hey, thatÅfs against the rulesÅc Though I guess heÅfs a guy. ÅgHikigaya-kun, what are you doing here?Åh ÅgAh, IÅfm a member of this clubÅc Why are you here?Åh ÅgI brought a new customer with me today, fufu~~.Åh YuigahamaÅfs pointlessly large breasts waved back and forth as she spoke proudly. I wasnÅft asking youÅc I wanted to hear that from TotsukaÅfs cute lipsÅc ÅgHey, come on--IÅfm a part of this club too, ya know? So I thought IÅfd earn my keep. And Sai-chan looked like he had something on his mind, so I brought him here.Åh 281 6-5 ÅgYuigahama-san.Åh ÅgYukinon, you really donÅft have to thank me. As a club member, this is the least I can do--Åh ÅgYuigahama-san, I really donÅft see how youÅfre a club memberÅcÅh ÅgIÅfm not?!Åh SheÅfs not?! ThatÅfs shockingÅc I thought it was pretty clear that she was slowly becoming part of the club. ÅgThat's right. You never handed in your application letter and our advisor has not recognized your membership, so youÅfre not a club member.Åh Yukinoshita was pointlessly strict when it came to the rules. ÅgIÅfll write one! If you want an application letter then IÅfll write you a million! Just let me join up!Åh Yuigahama had tears in her eyes as she took a piece of looseleaf and began to write. Ågapplication letterÅhÅc At least capitalize it, dammit.3 3 Actually, she begins to write it in hiragana, which comes off as really informal and kind of childish. 282 6-5 ÅgSo, Totsuka Saika-kunÅc Right? What do you want from us?Åh Yukinoshita ignored the hastily-writing Yuigahama and turned towards Totsuka. Totsuka began to shake as he was pinned in place by YukinoshitaÅfs cold stare. ÅgU-UmmÅc I wantÅc to make the tennis teamÅc better, I guessÅc?Åh Totsuka was looking at Yukinoshita at first, but as the sentence progressed, he slowly turned to look towards me. Totsuka was shorter than me, so he was looking up at me as he tried to gauge my reaction. Please donÅft stare at meÅc My heartÅfs starting to race, dammit, so look somewhere else. But just as I was thinking that, even though IÅfm sure she wasnÅft intending to save me, Yukinoshita answered in my place. ÅgI don't know what Yuigahama-san told you, but the service club is not some miracle cure-all. We are here only to help and promote independence. Whether the tennis team gets better or not completely depends on you.Åh ÅgIÅc seeÅcÅh 283 6-5 Totsuka shoulders drooped; he looked completely disapppointed. Yuigahama must have told him something to get his hopes upÅc ÅgWhereÅfs that seal, whereÅfs that sealÅcÅh4 Yuigahama muttered as she began to rummage through her bag. I glared at her, and as she felt my stare, she looked up. ÅgHuh? What is it?Åh ÅgDonÅft give me thatÅc You made irresponsible false promises, and now we have to break this young manÅfs fragile hopes and dreams.Åh Yukinoshita threw merciless words at Yuigahama, but Yuigahama just cocked her head in puzzlement. ÅgHm? Hmmm? But, I mean, I thought Yukinon and Hikki would definitely be able to do somethingÅc Was I wrong?Åh Yuigahama said that in a completely nonchalant tone. Depending on how you took that statement, you could almost hear a bit of a teasing challenge in it too. And, unfortunately, there was someone here who would take it just that way. 4 As in, a stamp that acts like a signature. 284 6-5 ÅgÅcÅcHmph. Now youÅfve said it, Yuigahama-sanÅc Whether the one over there can do anything is another issue, but to think you would try to test me like thisÅcÅh Yukinoshita laughed. Ahh, it looked like some weird switch had just flipped on inside of herÅc Yukinoshita Yukino was the kind of person who took all challenges head-on and used all her strength to smash them to pieces--hell, she would smash them to pieces even if she wasnÅft provoked. She was the kind of person who would mercilessly lay into even a peace-loving Gandhi like myself. ÅgWell then, fine, Totsuka-kun: I will accept your request. All I have to do is help you improve your tennis ability, right?Åh ÅgY-yes, thatÅfs right. I-if I get better, I think everyone else will try harder too.Åh Maybe he felt pressured by YukinoshitaÅfs wide-eyed stare, but Totsuka was hiding behind me as he answered. His face peeked out from just slightly above my shoulder, and I saw uneasy fear in his eyes. It was almost like looking at a trembling wild rabbitÅc And it made me want to put him in a bunny girl costume. Of course, when the Queen of Ice offered you her help, it was natural to feel scared. I could almost picture Yukinoshita saying something like, ÅgIÅfll make you stronger, but only if you give me your soul!Åh Was she a witch or something? I wanted to alleviate TotsukaÅfs unease, so I took one step forward to protect him. 285 6-5 When I was close to Totsuka, I could smell the scent of shampoo and deodorant. He smelled indescribably like a high school girlÅc What the hell kind of shampoo was he using? ÅgWell, itÅfs fine if we help, but what are we going to do?Åh ÅgI said it already, didnÅft I? Do you not remember? If you donÅft trust your memory, perhaps you should consider taking notes?Åh ÅgWait, donÅft tell me you were being serious back thereÅcÅh As I thought back to when Yukinoshita was saying things about forcing people to work Åguntil they died,Åh I saw Yukinoshita smile back at meÅc It was almost as if she was reading my thoughts. Damn was that smile scaryÅc TotsukaÅfs white skin became paler and he began to tremble. ÅgAm IÅc going to dieÅc?Åh ÅgItÅfs fine. IÅfll protect you.Åh I said that and pat Totsuka on the shoulder. When I did that, Totsuka blushed and sent me a heated look. 286 6-5 ÅgHikigaya-kunÅc Are you saying that seriously?Åh ÅgNah, sorryÅc I just kinda wanted to say it.Åh ÅgIÅfll protect youÅh is in any guy's top three list of ÅgThings I want to say.Åh (In case youÅfre curious, number one is ÅgLeave it to me--just go on ahead.Åh) In any case, if I was no match for Yukinoshita, then there was no way I could protect anyone from her. It was justÅc If I didnÅft say something to make Totsuka feel better, then his unease would never go away. Totsuka let out a short sigh and he frowned. ÅgI seriously canÅft understand Hikigaya-kun sometimesÅc butÅcÅh ÅgHm, so Totsuka-kun has tennis practice after school, correct? Well then, letÅfs start our special training sessions during lunch break. Shall we meet on the courts?Åh Yukinoshita interrupted Totsuka and began to quickly make plans for tomorrow and beyond. ÅgRoger~~!Åh 287 6-5 Yuigahama held out the application letter she had just finished writing as she answered. Totsuka also nodded. SoÅc That meantÅc ÅgSoÅc IÅfm going too?Åh ÅgNaturally. After all, itÅfs not like you have any other plans for lunch break, right?Åh ÅcNail on the head there. 288 6-6 6-6 And that was how our hellish training schedule was set. It would begin the next day. Why in the world did I have to join in? Ultimately, wasnÅft this service club just a little fenced-off garden for weaklings to gather and doze off? WasnÅft it just a club that collected worthless people and gave them a pleasant place to be for a while? And how was any of that different from the ÅgyouthÅh I so despised? Of course, Hiratsuka-sensei might be trying to turn this place into some kind of sanitarium, a place where we infected people could be isolated and treatedÅc Åcbut if our illnesses could really be cured by something so trivial, then we wouldnÅft be sick to begin with. Take Yukinoshita, for example. I have no idea what sort of things were weighing on her mind, but I knew that going to the club wouldn't make them go away. 289 6-6 Actually, the only way a place like this could heal my wounds would be if Totsuka were a girl. Maybe if, through this tennis stuff, some kind of love comedy bloomed between us, things would be a little differentÅc To my knowledge, Totsuka Saika was the cutest person in the world. He was sincere, and, more importantly, he was kind to me. If we took the time and effort to nurture our love for one another, then I might mature as a human being as well. ÅcBut, you know, Totsuka was a guy. God is an idiot. That made me a bit depressed, but I still finished changing into my jersey. Then I headed for the tennis courts. Hey, I was still holding onto the slim chance that he was a girl. IÅfd stake all my hopes and dreams on that chance! Our school jersey was a pointlessly fluorescent light blue, and it stood out a lot. The almost impressively unfashionable color scheme made every student hate those uniforms, so they never wore them except during gym or sports practices. So everyone else wore their normal uniforms, and I was the only one there standing out like an idiot in my jersey. That was why I was snared by an annoying person. ÅgHah hah hah hah Hachiman.Åh 290 6-6 ÅgDonÅft make my name part of your laughterÅcÅh In all of Soubu High, only Zaimokuza could possibly have such a disgusting laugh. He stood, arms crossed, blocking my way. ÅgWhat a fortuitous meetingÅc I was on my way to deliver my new work. Come, feast your eyes! Behold!Åh ÅgAhh, sorryÅc IÅfm a bit busy at the moment.Åh I slipped to the side, lightly dodging the bundle of papers he thrust out toward meÅc But Zaimokuza gently caught me by the shoulder. ÅgÅcDonÅft make up such sad lies. How in the world could you have plans?Åh ÅgItÅfs not a lieÅc And youÅfre the last person I want to hear that from.Åh Why did everyone say that? Did I really look like I really had so little to do with my time? ÅcWell, not that they were wrongÅc ÅgHmph, Hachiman, I understandÅc You simply wished to act cool for a bit, and so you made a small lie. And then, to protect that lie from exposure, you lied again. But that is an endless cycle, a tragic infinite cycle of deceit. See here, Hachiman, that spiral heads nowhere. 291 6-6 In general, human relationships head nowhere. But there is still time to pull yourself back from that abyss! ÅcYou helped me out once before, and now I will return the favor!Åh Zaimokuza's pronouncement was second place on the list of things every man wanted to say some day. The sight of him giving me a thumbs up with such a selfassured expression was annoying as hellÅc ÅgI really do have plansÅcÅh I could literally feel an angry vein throbbing in my head, and I prepared to subdue Zaimokuza with words. But thenÅc ÅgHikigaya-kun!Åh As those energetic soprano words reached me, I felt Totsuka jump into my arms. ÅgGreat timing. LetÅfs go together?Åh ÅgY-yeah, sureÅcÅh Totsuka was wearing his racquet bag on his left shoulder, and, for some reason, his right hand had grabbed my left. What the hellÅc 292 6-6 ÅgH-HachimanÅc W-who is thisÅc?Åh Zaimokuza looked back and forth between me and Totsuka with shocked eyes. And then his facial expression gradually changed into something somehow vaguely familiarÅc Ah, right, was it Kabuki? I could almost hear the Iyooo~~~ pon pon pon Kabuki sound effects1 as ZaimokuzaÅfs eyes widened and he struck a strange pose. ÅgY-you bastard! YouÅfve betrayed me!Åh ÅgWhat the hell do you mean ÅebetrayÅfÅcÅh ÅgShut up! You half-assed playboy! You failure of a pretty boy! I was taking pity on you because you were a loner, but I see that made you all cocky!Åh ÅgÅfHalf-assedÅf? ÅeFailureÅf? That's going too farÅcÅh I was a loner though, so I couldnÅft deny that last bit. Zaimokuza, still glaring at me with demonic eyes, groaned. 1 Kabuki theater is a very traditional form of Japanese dance-drama, often known for its colorful costumes and rather long, slow structure. This is the kind of sound effect that Hachiman is referring to. Gee, this translation comes with an accompanying audio guide too. IsnÅft that neat :D. 293 6-6 ÅgI definitely wonÅft forgive youÅcÅh ÅgHey, calm down, Zaimokuza. Totsuka isnÅft a girl. HeÅfs a guyÅc Probably.Åh ÅgD-dÅc D-donÅft screw with me! Someone that cute canÅft possibly be a guy!Åh I didnÅft sound very confident, and Zaimokuza shouted his response back at me. ÅgNo, Totsuka is definitely a cute guy.Åh ÅgThatÅfsÅc being called cuteÅc itÅfs a bitÅcÅh Totsuka, still standing next to me, was blushing and averting his eyes. ÅgUmmÅc Is he Hikigaya-kunÅfs friend?Åh ÅgThatÅfs a good questionÅcÅh ÅgHmphÅc ThereÅfs no way I'd consider the likes of him a Åefriend.ÅfÅh2 2 The kanji written here means Ågstrong enemy,Åh but the pronunciation given is Ågfriend.Åh 294 6-6 Zaimokuza was definitely sulking. Uwahh, this guy is a pain to deal withÅc But itÅfs not like I didnÅft get where he was coming from. It was natural to feel a little sad and betrayed if you found out that a guy you thought you could sympathize with, and then he turned out to be someone with a completely different set of values. What could I say in this kind of situation to restore our relationship? Unfortunately, given my low number of experience points in this area, I really didnÅft know. I felt a bit blue about this situation. I'd thought that Zaimokuza and I could, someday, get to a point that we could understand each other and laugh togetherÅc But it seemed that such a thing was be impossible. Checking on someone, trying to make people feel better, making sure you never fell out of touch, sympathizing with them, and then, by those means, finally getting closer to someoneÅc That kind of ÅgfriendshipÅh wasnÅft friendship at all. If such annoying things were what people called Ågyouth,Åh then I was completely fine without it. Hanging out in these stagnant groups, always acting like you were having fun, was nothing short of self-gratification. That self-gratification was nothing short of selfdeceit. What a despicable vice. 295 6-6 ÅcI mean, look at this situation; dealing with Zaimokuza's jealousy was insanely annoying. Once I had internally verified the rectitude of my own set of values, I pledged myself to the path of the loner. ÅgTotsuka, letÅfs go.Åh I pulled Totsuka by the arm. ÅgAh, okayÅcÅh He responded, but he didnÅft move. ÅgZaimokuza-kunÅc Was it?Åh Zaimokuza seemed at a bit of a loss, but finally gave a nod. ÅgIf youÅfre Hikigaya-kunÅfs friend, then maybe we couldÅc be friends too? That wouldÅc make me happy. I donÅft have many guy friendsÅcÅh Totsuka said that and gave a shy smile. ÅgFuÅc ku, ku ku ku ku. Indeed, Hachiman and I are close friendsÅc No, we are comradesÅc No no no, I am the master and he is the slaveÅc Well, when you put it like that, then I suppose I have no choice. I willÅc ummmÅc grace you with my friendship. We could even be lovers.Åh 296 6-6 ÅgUhh, I donÅft think thatÅfsÅc a good idea. LetÅfs just stick with friendship.Åh ÅgHm, I seeÅc Hey, Hachiman. You think this one here likes me? Does that mean IÅfm getting popular now? It does, right?Åh Zaimokuza quickly drew close to me and whispered into my ear. Åc As I thought: someone like Zaimokuza is no friend of mine. Someone who would do a complete one-eighty if they thought they could get close to a pretty girl was no friend of mine. ÅgÅcTotsuka, letÅfs goÅc If weÅfre late, then YukinoshitaÅfs going to explode.Åh ÅgHm, that wouldnÅft be good at allÅc Then let us hasten forth. That one isÅc seriously scary, after all.Åh Zaimokuza began to follow me and Totsuka. It seemed that he had decided to join the partyÅc After all, if we lined up like this and walked down the hall, anyone watching from the side would think that we came right out of Dragon Quest. Or, maybeÅc Not Dragon Quest, but something like King Bomby from the Momotetsu seriesÅc3 3 A board game video game, which is similar to Monopoly. 297 6-7 6-7 By the time we got to the tennis courts, Yukinoshita and Yuigahama were already there. Yukinoshita was still wearing her uniform, but Yuigahama had changed into her jersey. They had probably decided to eat lunch there. When they saw us, they both quickly cleared their incredibly small bento boxes. ÅgWell then, letÅfs begin.Åh ÅgI-I look forward to working with you.Åh Totsuka faced Yukinoshita and gave her a small bow. ÅgFirst, we have to build up the muscle strength that Totsuka-kun is fatally lacking. Biceps, deltoids, pectorals, abdominal muscles, obliques, dorsal muscles, femoral muscles--weÅfll all do pushups and build everything upÅc To start, please work until youÅfre ready to die.Åh ÅgUwaah, Yukinon seems really smartÅc Wait, ready to die?Åh 298 6-7 ÅgYes. The more you damage the muscles, the more they try to repair themselves, but each time they do, the muscular fibers grow stronger. This is what they call Åesupercompensation.Åf In other words, if you work yourself to the brink of death, then youÅfll be able to power up all in one go.Åh ÅgThe hell, weÅfre not Saiyans or somethingÅcÅh ÅgWell, you won't really be able to build muscle immediately this way, but it should also increase the speed of your basal metabolism.Åh ÅgBasal metabolism?Åh I could almost see the question mark above YuigahamaÅfs head. Did she seriously not even know that muchÅc? Yukinoshita seemed a bit stunned. She seemed to decide that it was better to just explain things than to pass blame around, though, so she explained it briefly. ÅgIn short, itÅfs a way to make your body more fit for exercise. If your basal metabolism rate increases, then it becomes easier for you to use calories. In other words, it increases your bodyÅfs energy conversion efficiency.Åh Yuigahama nodded at that explanation. Then her eyes suddenly sparkled. ÅgEasier to use caloriesÅc So weÅfd lose weight?Åh 299 6-7 ÅgÅcI suppose so. YouÅfll be able to use calories more easily, even when you're just breathing or digesting, so youÅfll get thinner without any special effort.Åh YukinoshitaÅfs words strengthened the sparkles in YuigahamaÅfs eyesÅc For some reason, it almost seemed as if Yuigahama was now filled with even more motivation than Totsuka. YuigahamaÅfs new motivation also seemed to trigger something in Totsuka, who clenched his fists tight. ÅgL-letÅfs try it out then.Åh ÅgI-IÅfm gonna start too!Åh Totsuka and Yuigahama lay down on their bellies and slowly began to do pushups. ÅgNnghÅc Khh, fuu, hahÅcÅh ÅgOoo, khhÅc Nnngh, hahh, hahh, nngh!Åh I heard pained, labored breathing. Their faces were warped with anguish, they both broke out into a light sweat, and their cheeks were flushed. Perhaps TotsukaÅfs slender arms made it especially hard for him, but he occasionally sent me pleading looks. When he looked up at me like that, from that positionÅc I dunnoÅc It made me feel kind of strange. 300 6-7 Each time YuigahamaÅfs arms bent, I caught a glimpse of the sparkling skin beyond her gym uniformÅfs collar. Not goodÅc I canÅft look at that straight on. My pulse began to race faster and faster, to the point where you could say I was experiencing arrhythmia. ÅgHachimanÅc What is this? For some reason, I feel completely at peaceÅcÅh ÅgWhat a coincidence. I feel the same way.Åh As we exchanged glances and smiled, a cool voice from behind me made me feel as if I was suddenly doused with cold water. ÅgÅcHow about you two exercise as well to get your minds out of the gutter?Åh When I turned around, I saw Yukinoshita standing there, looking at me with a truly scornful expression. Minds out of the gutterÅc Did she find us outÅc? ÅgH-hm. The warriorÅfs code demands that one never fall behind on training. I suppose I shall join in as well!Åh ÅgY-yeah. Being out of shape is scaryÅc You could get diabetes, or gout, or cirrhosis or something!Åh 301 6-7 We both dropped to the floor with alarming vigor and began to do pushups. As I exercised, Yukinoshita circled around to my front. ÅgWhen you do that, it almost looks like some new way of kowtowingÅcÅh Yukinoshita chuckled. That bastardÅc What did she just say? Even a peace-loving person like myself might feel something awaken inside, after something that rage-inducing. HehÅc Awaken what, exactly? If anything awoke, at most it'd be a new feeling of moe towards pushupsÅc ÅcWhat in the world were we all doing? Do you know the phrase Ågenough specks of dust can make a mountainÅh? Or maybe Ågthree heads are better than one.Åh In other words, when people gather together, they become even stronger and more secure. However, we were a group of failures who had gathered together to do pointless things. In the end, we spent the entire lunch break doing pushups, and I spent the entire night writhing in pain from sore muscles. 302 303 304 305 7-1 Chapter 7: Occasionally, the gods of romantic comedy can be kind. And so, as the days continued, we were soon thrust into phase two of our tennis training. That might have been a bit too dramatic. In other words, we had finished our basic training, and were finally practicing with actual equipment. Though, when I said Ågwe,Åh I really meant ÅgTotsuka.Åh He was the only one who had to spend all his time rallying against the wall, as per the instructions of the demonic instructor Yukinoshita. Well, itÅfs not like we could actually keep up with a tennis team member, so it was just free time for us. Yukinoshita just sat and read books under the shade of a nearby tree, but once in a while, when she seemed to remember that Totsuka was there, she would go over to check on him and issue further commands. Initially, Yuigahama had joined TotsukaÅfs practices, but she grew bored of it quickly and now spent most of her time napping next to Yukinoshita. She was like a dog someone had brought to the park, once it got tired and plopped down next to one of the park's watering holes. 306 7-1 And in true Zaimokuza fashion, he was earnestly working on developing his secret ultimate magic shot technique. Hey, stop throwing acorns, dammitÅc And stop digging up the clay court with your racquet. In the end, there was no use in gathering this many useless people in one place. And me, you ask? I was lazing around in one corner of the court observing ants. It was super fun. No, seriously, it was really fun. I donÅft know what those small things were thinking as they moved around so restlessly, but they were clearly just going on with their busy lives. I guess it made me feel like I was looking down at the street from some high-rise office in Tokyo. Those two images, of ants and of black-suited salarymen both scurrying about, overlapped in my head. Would I someday also become one of those black specks? Would someone else would see me from that same Tokyo high-rise? What would be on my mind at that time? 307 7-1 ItÅfs not like I hated the idea of being a salarymanÅc Hell, a part of me even wanted to become one. That was second place on my list of things I wanted to be, right after Ågfull-time house husband.Åh Number three on that list was Ågfire engine.Åh Wait, what the hell, I wanted to become a carÅc? I was, naturally, well aware that there were also bad points to salaryman work. I was always amazed when I saw my dad come home with this exhausted-with-life expression on his face. I admired the way he went to work every day, even if he was unhappy. So I suddenly projected the image of my dad onto one of those ants and began to cheer for him in my heart. Do your best, Dad; donÅft give up, Dad; donÅft lose your hair, Dad. I dreamed of my own future, and then began to worry about the future of my hair. My prayers might have gotten through, because that ant began to walk back towards the anthill where he belonged. IÅfm sure the warmth of his family was waiting for him there. IÅfm glad. I was overcome with emotion, sniffling and wiping away a tear. 308 7-1 It was at that moment-- Whoosh! ÅgDaaaaad~~!!!Åh There was no trace of that ant left; it and the incoming ball flew off to some faroff corner of the court. I glared with furious eyes at the source of that ball. ÅgHm, so you whip up a dust cloud to confuse your opponent and then take that opportunity to slam the ball at themÅc It seems my magic shot has been perfected, does it not? The earth of illusions brings forth a bountiful crop, ÅeBlasting Sand RockÅf!Åh Zaimokuza, so it was youÅc What did you do to my dad (the ant version)Åc? Well, whatever; it was just an ant. I clapped my hands together and offered a light prayer. Meanwhile, it seemed that Zaimokuza was immersed in the feeling of having perfected his new technique; he spun his racquet around and around before setting it on his shoulder and striking a pose. It was as if he had just gained a few experience points.d 309 7-1 Well, whatever--whatever to Zaimokuza, whatever to that ant. ÅcMaybe I should kill some time by watching whatever that cute Totsuka was doing. When I looked ahead, I saw that Yuigahama had woken up at some point. Yukinoshita had ordered her to laboriously carry around a ball cart. She would take balls from the cart and hurl them at Totsuka, and then Totsuka would try his utmost to get to those balls. ÅgYuigahama-san, please try to throw the balls in tougher locations, like over there or thereÅc This practice is meaningless otherwise.Åh Yukinoshita was calm and collected; Totsuka, on the other hand, was breathing heavily as he chased after balls at the line and then at the net. Yukinoshita was seriousÅc and seriously crazy. ÅcNo, she was just seriously trying to train Totsuka. Stop looking at me, dammitÅc ThatÅfs scary. How is it that you can read my mindÅc? YuigahamaÅfs aim was completely random (to say nothing of her form), and every ball she threw went off in some completely unpredictable direction. 310 7-1 Totsuka would run and try to catch up to the balls, but, sometime around the twentieth ball, he finally fell to the ground. ÅgUwah, Saichan! Are you okay?!Åh Yuigahama stopped throwing and ran to the net. Totsuka rubbed his grazed knees, but he smiled through his tear-filled eyes and tried to assert that he was fine. What a brave fellowÅc ÅgIÅfm fine, so letÅfs keep going.Åh However, Yukinoshita scowled once she heard that. ÅgYouÅc still want to keep going?Åh ÅgYeahÅc EveryoneÅfs helping me, so I want to put a bit more effort in.Åh ÅgÅcI see. Well, Yuigahama-san, IÅfll leave the rest to you.Åh Yukinoshita said that, then briskly turned on her heel and disappeared back into the school building. Totsuka seemed anxious as he watched her go. ÅgDid IÅc say something toÅc make her angryÅc?Åh 311 7-1 ÅgNah, sheÅfs just always like thatÅc Actually, she didnÅft call you stupid or untalented, so she might be in a pretty good mood.Åh ÅgDoesn't she only say that to Hikki?Åh Nah, Yuigahama, she says those things to you pretty oftenÅc You just donÅft notice. ÅgMaybe she justÅc got frustrated with meÅc? I havenÅft gotten any better, and I can only do five pushupsÅcÅh TotsukaÅfs shoulders drooped as he looked down at the floor. Hm, well, I guess that wasnÅft too out of character for YukinoshitaÅc HoweverÅc ÅgI donÅft think thatÅfs the case. Yukinon won't ever abandon people who come to her for help.Åh Yuigahama said that as she twirled a ball round and round in her hand. ÅgWell, thatÅfs trueÅc I mean, she even tried to help Yuigahama learn to cook. There's still some hope for you, so I doubt Yukinoshita's given up.Åh 312 7-1 ÅgWhatÅfs that supposed to mean?!Åh Yuigahama hurled her ball at my head. The ball scored a clean hit and made clonk! sort of sound. What the hell, her control was seriously goodÅc I wouldnÅft be surprised if she was picked in the next draft. I picked up the ball that was now rolling on the floor and tossed it lightly back to Yuigahama. ÅgSheÅfll probably come back eventually, soÅc Shall we keep going?Åh ÅgÅcOkay!Åh Totsuka answered energetically and went back to practicing. For a while after that, there was not another complaint uttered, nor were there any more tears. Totsuka was just trying his best. ÅgUgh, IÅfm so tired~~Åc Hikki, switch with me.Åh In fact, Yuigahama was the first one to complainÅc 313 7-1 Well, to be honest, I wasn't exactly doing much anyway. The only other option at the moment was to watch the ants again. ÅcBut Zaimokuza had murdered those ants, so I was completely bored now. I really had nothing to do. ÅgAll right. We can switch.Åh ÅgYay~~. Oh, by the way, this gets boring by the sixth throw, so be careful.Åh The sixth?! That was way too fast. Was her endurance really that terrible? As I went over to take the balls from Yuigahama, I saw her previously smiling expression turn a bit hazy and gloomy. ÅgAh, someoneÅfs playing tennis! Tennis!Åh I turned around at the sound of those merry-sounding voices, and saw a large group with Hayama and Miura at the center. They were walking towards us, and as they passed by Zaimokuza, they seemed to notice me and Yuigahama. ÅgAhÅc ItÅfs YuiÅcÅh 314 7-1 A girl next to Miura spoke in a soft voice. Miura took a single glance at me and Yuigahama, then ignored us and turned towards Totsuka. (It seemed that she hadnÅft ever looked at Zaimokuza.) ÅgHey, Totsuka. Can we play around here too?Åh ÅgMiura-san, IÅfm not reallyÅc playing aroundÅc IÅfm practicingÅcÅh ÅgHuh? What? I couldnÅft hear you.Åh Totsuka had spoken very softly, so Miura hadnÅft seemed to hear him. He fell silent at her response, butÅc I mean, if someone asked me a question that way, then I would definitely also be unable to talk. She was seriously scary. Totsuka gathered up what little courage he could find and tried again. ÅgI-IÅfm practicingÅcÅh But Her Highness didnÅft seem to give a damn. ÅgHmmm, but you know, there are people here who arenÅft on the tennis team, soÅc ItÅfs not like the boyÅfs tennis team has the courts reserved, right?Åh 315 7-1 ÅgT-thatÅfs trueÅc butÅcÅh ÅgWell, then isnÅft it fine if we use them too? Why wouldnÅft it be?Åh ÅgÅcButÅcÅh After he said that, Totsuka seemed troubled and looked towards meÅc Wait, me? Well, I guess there was no else he could turn to. Yukinoshita had gone off somewhere, Yuigahama was looking away with an uncomfortable expression on her face, and nobody cared about ZaimokuzaÅc So I guess there was only me. ÅgAh, sorry, but Totsuka asked to use this court, so we canÅft let other people use it.Åh ÅgHuh? But, like I said, youÅfre not on the tennis team and youÅfre using it.Åh ÅgAh, umm, thatÅfs just because weÅfre helping Totsuka practice, so itÅfs, like, outsourcing, or something.Åh ÅgHuh? What are you babbling about? ThatÅfs a bit gross.Åh 316 7-1 Uwah, this girl obviously had no intention of listening to us at allÅc That's why I hated that kind of stupid bitch. What kind of primate didn't understand language? Even dogs understand words, for GodÅfs sake. ÅgOkay, okay, letÅfs not get into a fight.Åh Hayama cut in and tried to mediate. ÅgCome on, itÅfs more fun if everyone plays. CanÅft we just do it that way?Åh HayamaÅfs words got on my nerves. Miura had cocked the rifle, but he had pulled the trigger. Well, I would just have to shoot back.1 ÅgWhat the hell do you mean by ÅeeveryoneÅfÅc? Is it the same ÅeeveryoneÅf you use to beg your parents for something? Like, when you go ÅeBut everyone else has one!Åf or somethingÅc? Who the hell is that ÅeeveryoneÅfÅc? I donÅft have any friends, so IÅfve never been able to use that lineÅcÅh ItÅfs the double meaning between ÅgshootÅh and ÅggloomÅh! A miraculous combination! 1 Untranslatable pun incoming. The word for Ågto shootÅh in Japanese sounds like the word for Åggloom.Åh 317 7-1 Even Hayama had to be moved by that. ÅgAh, ummÅc I didnÅft mean anything by that. UmmÅc IÅfm sorry, I guess? If you have something on your mind, then you can always come to me for advice.Åh He began to comfort me with incredible speed. Hayama was a good personÅc I almost felt myself start to tear up and thank him. ButÅc If I could be saved by that kind of cheap sympathy, then I wouldn't need saving to begin with. If my problems just required a few kind words, then I wouldnÅft really have problems. ÅgÅcHayama, your kindness makes me happy. I know all too well now that you have a good personality. And youÅfre also the ace of the soccer team. And youÅfre also pretty good looking, arenÅft you? IÅfm sure you can get pretty popular with the ladies!Åh ÅgW-whatÅfs this all of a suddenÅc?Åh Hayama was clearly shaken by my sudden flattery. Good, good, feel free to get full of yourself. 318 7-1 Hayama, IÅfll bet you donÅft knowÅc Why do you think people compliment other people? ItÅfs because the bigger you are, the harder you fall! It's called Ågdeath by praise.Åh ÅgYou have so much, you are so brilliant, and yet you want to steal these tennis courts away from us who have nothing? Do you feel no shame?Åh ÅgPrecisely! Mister Hayama! What youÅfre doing is the lowest of the low! ItÅfs an invasion! Vengeance shall be mine!Åh2 At some point, Zaimokuza had come over and started spitting out flamboyant things. ÅgW-when the two of them stand together, then the situation just gets twice as pathetic and sadÅcÅh Yuigahama was standing speechless next to us, and Hayama scratched his head. He let out a short sigh. 2 The title of a novel by Saki Ryuuzou. 319 7-1 ÅgHm, well, hmmÅcÅh Despite myself, a wicked grin appeared on my face. ExactlyÅc Hayama wasnÅft the kind of person who liked making trouble anywhere. And right now, that ÅganywhereÅh precisely consisted of him, Zaimokuza, and myself. If he was shot down by the majority, then Hayama would have no choice but to give this place up. ÅgHey, come on, Hayato~~ÅcÅh A lazy voice slipped in from the side. ÅgWhat are you just standing there for? I want to play tennis.Åh And the idiot with the curls had arrived. Was there something wrong with her brain cells? Keep up with the conversation, dammitÅc YouÅfre the type of person who gets the brake and the gas pedal mixed up, arenÅft you? Indeed, Miura had pushed the gas pedal instead of the brakes. And that gave Hayama a bit more time to think. That little pause was enough to turn the ignition key in his brain. 320 7-1 ÅgHm, all right, then letÅfs do this: all the people not on the team will play a match, and the ones who win will be able to use the courts during lunch break from now on. Naturally, the winners will also help Totsuka practice. ItÅfs always better to practice with better players, right? That would be more fun for everyone.Åh ÅcWhat the hell was up with that completely flawless logic? Was he a genius? ÅgTennis match? ÅcHm, that sounds really fun.Åh Miura gave the kind of fierce smile that only the Queen of Fire could. And all the hangers-on also seemed to be greatly roused by that suggestion of HayamaÅfs. And so, swept away by the heat of impending battle, bowing to chaos and frenzy, we were thrust into phase three of our training. Åcthat might have sounded a bit too cool. In other words, we were betting the tennis courts on a match. How the hell had it come to thisÅc? 321 7-2 7-2 My earlier choice of words, with all that talk about ÅgchaosÅh and Ågfrenzy,Åh was me trying to be funny. In the end, though, I was right. Quite a few people had begun to crowd around the tennis courts, which were located in one corner of the schoolyard. If I were to count, I would say that we had two hundred people here, easy. That of course inlcuded Hayama's group, but there were plenty of other people who had come after hearing about the event. Most of those people were HayamaÅfs friends or his fans. They were mostly second-years, but there were a few first-years mixed in, and I also saw a thirdyear here and there. Was this guy for realÅc? He was more popular than our politicians. ÅgHA~ YA~ TO~ GO!! HA~ YA~ TO~ GO!!Åh The spectators who were cheering for Hayama started to do the wave. It was like being in the middle of an idol concertÅc But most people here probably werenÅft huge Hayama fans, they were just here to watch a strange event. Åcright? IÅfd really like to believe thatÅc 322 7-2 In any case, looking at the crowd around me sent chills down my spine. It was like a religious cultÅc The church of youth is a scary thing indeed. And Hayama Hayato emerged from that chaotic melting pot, confidently striding out to the center of the court. Despite the huge audience, he seemed perfectly at ease. He was probably used to that much attention. In addition to his usual followers, some girls and boys from other classes had joined him. We'd been swallowed whole, more or less. Our glances darted back and forth and back and forth. I closed my eyes; I could feel myself growing dizzy from the earshattering commotion. Hayama was already gripping his racquet and was standing on the court. He stared at us with interest, wanting to know which one of us would step up first. (Hayama was already standing on the court, racquet in hand. He stared at us, curious, wanting to know which one of us would step up first.) ÅgHeyÅc Hikki, what should we do?Åh ÅgWhat should we do, huhÅcÅh Yuigahama seemed uneasy. I took a glance at Totsuka; he looked like a frightened bunny dropped in an unfamiliar forest. 323 7-2 Even when he talked to me, he did so really timidly and with his feet turned inwards. Geez, that was insanely cuteÅc I wasnÅft the only one who thought so. As Totsuka walked, looking so vulnerable, I heard girls all around us give high-pitched squeals of ÅgPrince~~!!Åh or ÅgSaichaaan~~!!Åh But every time Totsuka heard one of those cries, he just trembled. Seeing that just made TotsukaÅfs fans writhe in pleasure and cheer even more. I couldnÅft help but writhe in pleasure a bit myself. ÅgSo I guess Totsuka canÅft participateÅcÅh Hayama had said that this match would be between people who werenÅft on the teamÅc In other words, this was a match to win the courts and Totsuka himself. ÅgÅcZaimokuza, can you play tennis?Åh ÅgLeave it to me. IÅfve read through all the volumes and I even went to see the musical, so IÅfm quite the expert in el tenis.Åh 324 7-2 ÅgI was an idiot to ask youÅc And if youÅfre going to say tennis in Spanish, then say musical in Spanish too.Åh1 ÅgWell then, in that case itÅfs up to youÅc Wait, how do you say ÅemusicalÅf in Spanish?Åh ÅgYeah, I guess I have toÅcÅh ÅgDo you think you have a good shot at victory? Åc And, seriously, how do you say ÅemusicalÅf in Spanish?!Åh ÅgNo shot at allÅc Also, shut up. If you canÅft figure it out, then change your damn character instead. YouÅfve already broken character completely anyways.Åh ÅgI-I seeÅc Hachiman, youÅfre pretty smart, arenÅft you?Åh Zaimokuza seemed seriously impressed. It seemed that I'd solved his problem, but I couldn't solve any of my ownÅc Ugh. What should I do? I buried my head in my crossed arms. As I did, I heard a rude, irritated voice. ÅgHey, canÅft you hurry it up?Åh 1 This is really tough to translate, but Zaimokuza says ÅgmusicalÅh in pseudo-English (i.e. English just pronounced in Japanese) while he says ÅgtennisÅh in Japanese. This is strange because tennis is usually spoken in pseudo-english (as ÅgtenisuÅh). To try to mimic this effect, I used Spanish instead of Japanese, but I admit the correspondence is far from perfect. 325 7-2 God, that bitch was annoyingÅc I lifted my head and saw Miura holding a racquet and checking it over. Hayama also seemed to think that was unusual. ÅgHuh? YumikoÅfs gonna play too?Åh ÅgWhat? Yeah, obviouslyÅc IÅfm the one who wanted to play tennis, remember?Åh ÅgI know, butÅc The other team is going to probably send out a guy. You know, that, ummÅc Hikitani-kun guy? Him. If you had to play him, it wouldnÅft be too fair.Åh Who the hell is Hikitani-kun? Hikitani-kun wasnÅft playing. Hikigaya-kun was playingÅc probably playing. Miura listened to Hayama's warning and fell into thought, playing with her long curly strands of hair. ÅgOh, then letÅfs do mixed doubles! Geez, IÅfm pretty smart, arenÅft I? But is there seriously a girl who wants to play with Hikitani-kun? Haha, thatÅfs hilarious!Åh Miura started to let out a high-pitched, vulgar laugh, and the audience began to laugh as well. I couldnÅft help but laugh myself. 326 7-2 Ku ku ku, ku ku kuÅc Ugh, it hurt to admit it, but that was really effective. I could feel myself plunging into darkness. ÅgHachiman, this isnÅft goodÅc You have no female friends at all, and no girl will help out a plain-looking loner bastard like you, even if you ask. What are you going to do?Åh Shut up, ZaimokuzaÅc And he was completely right, so I couldnÅft even argue with him. We were past the point where I could just go Ågahahah sorry~~. LetÅfs just forget all about this wink
